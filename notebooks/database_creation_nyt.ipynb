      "        context: But the imposition of a single theme -- say , arranging the entire history around the rise and fall of the welfare state , or North-South relations -- would be arbitrary and Procrustean . The best three measures of historical balance are , I would think , chronology , geography and genre , and in all those respects Roberts passes the test . Achieving a chronological balance is , of course , the easiest to do : he simply allocated about half the book -LRB- in this case , approximately 15 chapters and some 400 pages -RRB- to the period before the cold war , and the other half -LRB- about 14 chapters and another 400 pages -RRB- to world events since the late 1940 's . \n",

This does not mean that one could assemble from this tour d'horizon a composite history of , say , Latin America in the 20th century : such regions sort of meander in and out of the story , depending upon their pertinence to Roberts 's more general themes and arguments . Nevertheless , this is a genuine and , on the whole , successful effort at a global history , which always has to acknowledge that most of the impulses for change originated and were grappled with first in the North , and yet not ignore the story of what was going on in the South , especially as its peoples , too , encountered the new ideas , technologies and forces for social transformation . \n",

But it is in the third dimension -- that of balancing the different genres of history and of comprehending its seamless web -- that Roberts is at his best . Perhaps this is because he deliberately starts the book by creating a very large framework -- almost as if he were describing the features of the planet Earth to a set of extraterrestrial tourists who were completely ignorant of this new world on their intergalactic journey . \n",

One final aspect of Roberts 's book completes this reviewer 's satisfaction at his marvelous distillation : it is the sure and firm way that he brackets this complicated story with both a fine introduction that poses large questions of how to write such a history in any case -LRB- there is a really good , small section on '' The Different Pasts of 1901 '' -RRB- and a complementary retrospective chapter on the meaning of the 20th century . All told , this is a book that deserves the widest reading because it is about one of the most important historical stories of all -- namely , what happened in the most dynamic and recent century of humankind 's journey through time . \n",
