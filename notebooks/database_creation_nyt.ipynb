      "The question before Attorney General Janet Reno, the two branches of the Gonzalez family and the people of Miami is how to make the transfer as painless as possible for the young Cuban boy.[3] Yesterday 's appellate court order temporarily barring his return to Cuba, while not directly related to the issue of his return to his father, helps to give everyone involved a few hours or days to search for a compassionate resolution.[4] | Yesterday 's appellate court order temporarily barring his return to Cuba, while not directly related to the issue of his return to his father, helps to give everyone involved a few hours or days to search for a compassionate resolution.[4] The burden of doing so rests primarily on Elian 's Miami relatives, who have stubbornly resisted every reasonable effort to find an amicable ending.[5] | Miami is the loser in this spectacle.[15] The relatives further damaged their cause yesterday by airing a videotape of Elian declaring that he does not want to return to Cuba.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But what was expected to be the day 's most dramatic scene, a potential 2 p.m. showdown between the federal government and the boy 's Miami relatives, never took place, leaving the biggest development of the day the release of a home video of Elian himself, appealing to his father not to take him back to Cuba.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuban-Americans in the Miami area said this week that they would physically block federal agents if they tried to remove Elian from his relatives' home there.[2] And Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County, speaking for himself and other local officials, said their police would not help if the federal government acted'' inappropriately'' to send Elian back to his father in Cuba.[3] | In Cuba, law is the arbitrary power of one man.[12] Attorney General Janet Reno, who comes from Miami, appealed to the Miami residents in an unusually personal statement.''[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, on Thanksgiving, the Miami relatives phoned Cuba with the news that Elian had been pulled from the sea by a couple of fishermen.[16] | In Miami, lawyers for the Gonzalez family claim that she and Munero had been hounded by the authorities because of his troubles with the law.[302] In Cuba, officials insist that Munero must have coerced Elisa into making the trip.[303] | As in Cuba, it has grown steadily more difficult in Miami to untangle the thoughts of Elian 's relatives from those of their advisers, lawyers and political hangers-on.[354] | But while he has worked closely with the politicians in Miami and Washington, his own politics have remained vague.[360] Many of his relatives say they had thought of him as one of the least politically minded of his brothers, and his life in Cuba was not marked by open conflict with the government.[361] | -LRB- Luis Cid is awaiting trial in the strong-arm robbery of a tourist in Little Havana last year -RRB- Among the Gonzalez cousins who have been most important to the story told in Miami is one who came from Cuba little more than a year ago, Alfredo Martell.[369] | His mother and sister, who remain in Cardenas, can not understand why their own family in Miami has put Juan Miguel through such agony.[371] Instead, Alfredo has been a font of assertions meant to undermine Juan Miguel: that Elian 's father wanted to move to America himself; that he sometimes beat up Elisa; that he, too, felt betrayed by what has happened to Cuba over the last decade.[372] | Of all the family members in the United States, they are the ones who have remained closest to their relatives in Cuba, and they are the ones who have tried hardest to persuade the others to give Elian back to Juan Miguel.[394]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The standoff between the United States government and Miami 's Cuban exiles over Elian Gonzalez remained locked in place today, as the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit considered whether to grant family members here an emergency stay that would delay his return to Cuba until the court hears the full appeal in May.[1] | And Thursday is the anniversary of last year 's shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.'' It 's up to the government right now,'' said Barbara Lagoa, a lawyer for the boy 's Miami relatives.[15] Meanwhile, in Cuba tonight, state-run television for the first time showed the house in Havana where Elian is expected to stay after his'' eventual'' return.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Associates said Ms. Reno went to Miami because she felt comfortable in the fiery politics and passions that have swirled through Miami 's Cuban-American community since Elian, then 5 years old, was pulled last Thanksgiving from the Atlantic Ocean off Florida after fleeing Cuba with his mother.[4] | Despite her positive feelings about Cubans in Miami, it is clear they do not necessarily feel the same toward her, adding to the political riskiness of the endeavor.[12] Cuban-Americans here have said repeatedly that Ms. Reno never allowed the boy his day in court and seemed to be trying to strong-arm the family in her insistence in sending Elian the boy back to Cuba.[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who arrived from Cuba nine days ago and is staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat in Bethesda, Md., has said the accusations are false and has characterized them as a desperate ploy by his Miami relatives to keep the boy.[46]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Clinton administration is inexorably increasing the pressure on the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez to reunite him with his father -- and hoping it happens without resistance.[1] President Clinton, who has reason to be chary of the lingering cold war passions that divide the United States and Cuba, has tried to moderate the tensions set off by the case of the Cuban boy.[2] | As president, Mr. Clinton has walked a careful line on relations with Cuba, at once offering modest steps to increase cooperation and travel between the two countries while maintaining the strict 38-year-old economic embargo on the island.[14] Acting on cue from the president, officials from the White House, State Department and Justice Department all expressed hope in public and private this week that the boy 's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who arrived here on Thursday from Cuba, could work out an amicable custody deal with his Miami relatives, who have kept Elian since he was rescued at sea last Thanksgiving.[15] | Acting on cue from the president, officials from the White House, State Department and Justice Department all expressed hope in public and private this week that the boy 's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who arrived here on Thursday from Cuba, could work out an amicable custody deal with his Miami relatives, who have kept Elian since he was rescued at sea last Thanksgiving.[15] | There is great concern if the family in Miami seeks a confrontation, there 's no telling what direction this could go in.''[26] Robert Pastor, who handled Latin American policy at the National Security Council under President Jimmy Carter, said that Mr. Clinton should harbor little hope of separating the Gonzalez case from 40 years of pained history between the United States and Cuba.[27]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The vice president apparently acted out of concern that supporting the administration 's desire to return Elian to Cuba promptly could cost the Gore campaign Cuban-American votes in Florida and elsewhere.[13] Despite agreement on the law and the desired outcome of the case within the administration as a whole, there has been mounting frustration at the White House and the State Department, where officials feel that the Justice Department and immigration authorities moved too slowly early in the case and showed too much deference to Elian 's relatives in Miami.[14] | A new effort, endorsed by Mr. Gore today, was undertaken this week by two Republican senators, Connie Mack of Florida and Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire, and one Democrat, Bob Graham of Florida, to grant Elian and his family in Cuba permanent-residency status, a step somewhat short of citizenship.[21] The senators accused the Justice Department of running roughshod over the rights of the boy 's relatives in Miami, and called on Mr. Clinton to suspend all deportation proceedings.[22]\n",

      "To a chorus of boos, shouts and cheers at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, Bill Bradley and Al Gore engaged last night in the most brutal presidential debate of the year, with Mr. Bradley attacking the vice president as a'' conservative Democrat'' and Mr. Gore caustically describing Mr. Bradley as a'' desperate'' candidate intent on tearing down his fellow Democrat.[1] | Senator Bradley,'' Mr. Gore responded,'' a couple of days ago, your campaign said that you wanted to get some things off your chest.[6] | Mr. Bradley, speaking to a mostly black audience, repeatedly attacked Mr. Gore for voting in 1981 in Congress to overturn an Internal Revenue Service ruling that would forbid tax exemptions to private colleges with racially discriminatory practices, saying that it would help schools like Bob Jones University in South Carolina.[11] Early in the debate, Mr. Bradley produced a sheaf of papers, which he said included a stack of the bills Mr. Gore had supported, and tried to thrust them into Mr. Gore 's hand.[12] | Early in the debate, Mr. Bradley produced a sheaf of papers, which he said included a stack of the bills Mr. Gore had supported, and tried to thrust them

foreswear any more 30-second televised advertisements.[13] | Mr. Bradley ignored Mr. Gore 's hand that Sunday morning, and Mr. Gore returned the gesture last night.[14] | Mr. Gore noted that the bill Mr. Bradley referred to dealt with quotas and that it had been approved by an overwhelming majority in Congress, with the votes of most Democrats, and, describing the assertion that Bob Jones University would have benefited as a'' phony and scurrilous charge.''[15] | And trying to turn the tables on Mr. Bradley on another issue of concern to this audience, Mr. Gore questioned why Mr. Bradley had voted against expanding the number of broacast franchises available to minorities.[16] | Time, time, time,'' the moderator, Bernard Shaw, said repeatedly as Mr. Gore, in particular, attempted to ride past the deadlines, responding to Mr. Bradley, who was by far more animated than he has ever been before.''[18] | Mr. Gore responded by portraying Mr. Bradley as desperate and untrustworthy, asserting that his health care program endangered the elderly and AIDS patients.[28] | Mr. Gore said.[31] At times, it seemed unlikely that anyone in the audience -- or watching on

George Stephanopoulus, Mr. Clinton 's former senior aide, to assert that Mr. Gore had worked in the administration to undermine affirmative action.[33] | Mr. Gore repeatedly affirmed his commitment to the program last night.[34] The debate was the first in a month, and came at a particularly critical time for Mr. Bradley, whose campaign nationally -- and in New York, a state where he had once been seen as posing a powerful challenge to Mr. Gore -- has seemed increasingly adrift.[35] | The debate was the first in a month, and came at a particularly critical time for Mr. Bradley, whose campaign

session as a chance, arguably one of his last before New York and several other crucial states hold primaries on March 7, to effectively put his campaign back on the map.[36] It was the second time

hand of a white man as a wallet, but a wallet in the hand of a black man as a gun,'' Mr. Bradley said.[45] Mr. Bradley repeated his earlier exhortations of why Mr. Gore did not simply stroll down the hall to ask President Clinton to issue an executive order, immediately, banning racial profiling.[46] | Mr. Bradley repeated his earlier exhortations of why Mr. Gore did not simply stroll down the

back.[47] | And so in the coming weeks, Mr. Gore began battering Mr. Bradley from every direction.[48] | As the 2000 campaign unfolded, there came to be growing doubts among Democrats that Mr. Bradley

in Iowa needed it after those '93 floods?''[89] | There were times, however, when Mr. Bradley more than held his own in debates.[93] On the NBC News program'' Meet the Press'' in December, Mr. Bradley

a slight but significant increase in the number of New York City voters who held an unfavorable view of the Republican mayor, a notable development given the importance Mr. Giuliani 's advisers have attached to the mayor making a strong showing in his overwhelmingly Democratic city.[14] | Nearly 75 percent of the supporters of both Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton asserted that their minds were made up, and said they could not envision voting for the other candidate.[20] | The one-point difference between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani, which is statistically indistinguishable from their standing

Teitelbaum, Mr. Giuliani 's campaign manager, asserted, grinning broadly as he released the Republican mayor 's side of what by day 's end was a fairly lopsided fund-raising picture.[3] Mr. Teitelbaum said that more than half of Mr. Giuliani 's total contributions came from out of state, though he contended that the strong showing -- news of which clearly unsettled some of Mrs. Clinton 's supporters -- was as much a tribute to Mr. Giuliani as a testament to Mrs. Clinton 's unpopularity.[4] | Mr. Teitelbaum said that more than half of Mr. Giuliani 's total contributions came from out of state, though he contended that the strong showing -- news of which clearly unsettled some of Mrs. Clinton 's supporters -- was as much a tribute to Mr. Giuliani as a testament to Mrs. Clinton 's unpopularity.[4] | He said Mr. Giuliani had raised$ 7 million in the reporting period required under federal law, from Jan. 1 to March 31, for a total of$ 19 million for his campaign.[5] Mrs. Clinton 's campaign aides said she had raised about$ 4 million in the period, bringing her total to about$ 12 million.[6] | The report by Mr. Giuliani was startling, not only because of its size -- the mayor has already raised more money than Charles E. Schumer collected for his entire Senate contest in 1998 -- but also because the figures appeared to undercut what had once been a widespread assumption of the contest: that Mrs. Clinton would raise more money than Mr. Giuliani.[8] | Earlier this year, Mrs. Clinton 's advisers said they were confident that she would raise$ 25 million for her campaign; she has yet to reach the halfway point toward that.[9] Last night, Mrs. Clinton 's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, said he was now certain that Mr. Giuliani would raise'' at least several million more dollars'' than Mrs. Clinton.''[10] | Last night, Mrs. Clinton 's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, said he was now certain that Mr. Giuliani would raise'' at least several million more dollars'' than Mrs. Clinton.''[10] | Mr. Teitelbaum called a formal news conference to announce the figures, which he presented in a series of brightly colored charts, filled with graphic illustrations that demonstrated the scope of Mr. Giuliani 's accomplishment for the sake of the television cameras at the back of the room.[12] By contrast, Mrs. Clinton disclosed her figure in a short statement e-mailed to reporters.[13] | By contrast, Mrs. Clinton disclosed her figure in a short statement e-mailed to reporters.[13] Mr. Giuliani now seems certain to break the fund-raising record of$ 21 million set in Virginia by a nonincumbent candidate for Senate, Oliver L. North, in 1994.[14] | He has already surpassed Mr. Schumer, who raised$ 17 million in his race in 1998, and his advisers say they think he may end up raising close to$ 40 million.[15] The splurge of fund-raising was condemned yesterday by Theodore W. Kheel, the former labor negotiator who has taken the lead in trying to work out an agreement between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani to renounce voluntarily the use of unregulated soft money in the campaign.''[16] | The splurge of fund-raising was condemned yesterday by Theodore W. Kheel, the former labor negotiator who has taken the lead in trying to work out an agreement between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani to renounce voluntarily the use of unregulated soft money in the campaign.''[16] | But Mr. Giuliani seems likely to enjoy an advantage in this area.[25] Unlike Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Giuliani has yet to hire much of a campaign staff, a reflection of the fact that he has not done much campaign traveling and has a network of City Hall aides.[26] | Unlike Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Giuliani has yet to hire much of a campaign staff, a reflection of the fact that he has not done much campaign traveling and has a network of City Hall aides.[26] | For one thing, no matter how Mrs. Clinton stands in comparison to Mr. Giuliani, she has raised what in any other Senate race would be a huge amount.[32] | Senator D'Amato, Senator North and Senator Huffington can all attest to the fact that more money does n't necessarily get you elected to the Senate,'' said Howard Wolfson, her press secretary, referring to unsuccessful Senate campaigns by Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. North, and Michael Huffington in California.[34] Mr. Wolfson said Mr. Giuliani 's figures reflected the success in sending fund-raising letters portraying Mrs. Clinton as a far-left candidate to conservatives.''[35]\n",

      "With huffs and puffs and language that seemed more suited to nuclear arms negotiations than a contest for the United States Senate, aides to Mayor Rudolph W.

Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, as she asserted that Republican policies would harm the public schools.''[3] | Mrs. Clinton 's choice of where to speak -- a United Federation of Teachers convention for teachers' aides -- underscored her increasingly deep ties to the powerful union, which has regularly battled with Mr. Giuliani and has emerged as one of her most prominent supporters.[10] | Mr. Giuliani, through a spokeswoman, would not comment on either Mrs. Clinton 's education proposals or the criticism of his education record.[11] | Mrs. Clinton gave no hint of how much she thought all this would cost, or how it might be financed.[19] She also assailed vouchers, which Mr. Giuliani has presented as a tool to help parents in New York City assure a good education for their children, but which Mrs. Clinton and the teachers' union say would lead to a flow of money and students out of the public school system.[20] | She also assailed vouchers, which Mr. Giuliani has presented as a tool to help parents in New York City assure a good education for their children, but which Mrs. Clinton and the teachers' union say would lead to a flow of money and students out of the public school system.[20] | Mrs. Clinton 's speech wove together a number of different threads of her campaign.[27] It allowed her to criticize Mr. Giuliani 's record on education -LRB- polls show education is one of the top two concerns of New Yorkers -RRB-.[28] | It also allowed her to reprise an older campaign theme by raising questions about Mr. Giuliani 's temperament, while returning to a new line of attack, attaching Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Bush.[29] At the same time, Mrs. Clinton firmly latched her own fortunes to those of the presumptive Democratic nominee, Mr. Gore.''[30] | Still, once again, as she discussed the state of schools in New York City, the first lady sounded as if she had set her sights on City Hall, rather than the United States Capitol; indeed, some of her remarks were evocative of the attacks Ruth W. Messinger, the Democratic candidate for mayor, made against Mr. Giuliani when she challenged him in 1997.[34] Mrs. Clinton lamented the physical condition of New York City classrooms she had viewed, worried about an impending teacher shortage, and warned of overcrowding in public schools with the start of the next school year.''[35] | Correction: March 14, 2000, Tuesday A picture caption in some copies on Sunday about Hillary Rodham Clinton 's criticism of Mayor Rudolph W.
