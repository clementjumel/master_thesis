It is true that Mr. Bradley has championed some legislation favored by the drug industry, but the Clinton-Gore administration has also helped pharmaceutical companies on certain issues, and the Clinton-Gore ticket has raked in plenty of their money, too.\n",
      "sample_4:  It is true that Mr. Bradley has championed some legislation favored by the drug industry, but the Clinton-Gore administration has also helped pharmaceutical companies on certain issues, and the Clinton-Gore ticket has raked in plenty of their money, too.  During the Bradley-Gore debate on the NBC program'' Meet the Press'' two weekends ago, Mr. Gore, trying to paint Mr. Bradley as hypocritical on the issue of campaign finance reform, noted that Mr. Bradley had received campaign contributions from'' all the C.E.O.'s of the major pharmaceutical companies.''  Mr. Bradley tried to respond, but the vice president abruptly cut him off to press his attack.\n",
      "sample_10:  The drug industry does not rank among the top industry groups contributing to his campaign-LRB- his top contributors include individuals tied to investment banks and law firms-RRB-.  None of Mr. Bradley's 30 top fund-raisers is affiliated with a drug company or a health care concern-- while several of Mr. Gore's closest advisers are paid lobbyists for major drug companies.  Still, Mr. Bradley was widely considered one of the industry's most effective defenders in Congress.\n",
      "sample_14:  He sponsored tariff reductions for raw materials needed in drug manufacturing that would benefit home-state pharmaceutical companies, and he voted to kill a 1992 amendment that would have imposed cost controls on medicines.  Mr. Gore, in campaign literature, also notes that Mr. Bradley received$ 96,160 from employees of major pharmaceutical companies in his three campaigns for the Senate from 1978 to 1990.  Again, that is a small percentage of his overall Senate fund-raising total of more than$ 20 million.\n",
      "sample_16:  Again, that is a small percentage of his overall Senate fund-raising total of more than$ 20 million.  Nonetheless, Mr. Gore has made Mr. Bradley's ties to the pharmaceutical industry a central point of attack and a defining distinction between the two Democrats.''  For voters looking for a clear difference between the two candidates, they do n't need to look any farther than the prescription drug issue,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman.''\n",
      "sample_18:  For voters looking for a clear difference between the two candidates, they do n't need to look any farther than the prescription drug issue,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman.''  Al Gore has devoted a good portion of his career to making prescription drugs more accessible and more affordable while Senator Bradley has taken a lot of money from the New Jersey pharmaceutical companies and represented their interests.''  It is true that Mr. Gore's stand on prescription drugs has pitted him against the pharmaceutical industry.\n",
      "sample_22:  That money, in fact, far eclipses the amounts that have gone to Mr. Bradley.  In the 1996 presidential election alone, drug company employees donated$ 94,325 to the Clinton-Gore committee-- almost as much as Mr. Gore says Mr. Bradley received in his three Senate campaigns.  Pharmaceutical employees donated$ 36,000 to the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign.\n",
      "sample_24:  Pharmaceutical employees donated$ 36,000 to the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign.  Mr. Gore also accepted$ 50,200 in donations from the political action committees of major pharmaceutical companies for his House and Senate races from 1983 to 1990 and for his political action committee in 1998, according to a review of Federal Election Commission reports by the Bradley campaign.  In addition, election commission records show that pharmaceutical manufacturers gave the Democratic Party$ 2.3 million in unrestricted soft money donations for the 1996 campaign and$ 829,000 for the 1992 campaign, some of which almost certainly benefited the Clinton-Gore ticket by paying for political advertising, polling and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n",
      "sample_32:  Mr. Bradley voted against the Zantac patent extension, arguing that generic substitutes for the medication would be cheaper for consumers.  Officials in the pharmaceutical industry said Mr. Bradley had been responsive to their concerns, but they dismissed Mr. Gore's attacks as campaign posturing.  They said that Mr. Bradley had not consulted them before announcing his health care plan and expressed concern that it could lead to price controls on prescription drugs-- a move they consider the greatest threat government poses to their industry.''\n",

On the second day of a two-day bus tour through western Iowa, Mr. Bradley used audiences of students and teachers to promote his proposals for expanding preschool programs, helping schools hire 60,000 new teachers a year and improving community colleges.\n",
      "sample_3:  On the second day of a two-day bus tour through western Iowa, Mr. Bradley used audiences of students and teachers to promote his proposals for expanding preschool programs, helping schools hire 60,000 new teachers a year and improving community colleges.  Mr. Gore, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, has placed education at the heart of his campaign and has repeatedly criticized Mr. Bradley for not highlighting the issue more strongly.  But today, Mr. Bradley issued a statement criticizing Mr. Gore for proposing to increase military spending over the next decade by$ 127 billion, which would be$ 12 billion more than the increase he proposes for education.''\n",
      "sample_11:  Many Iowa Democrats support holding down military spending, in part because there is a strong nuclear-disarmament movement in the state and in part because the state receives little money from the Pentagon budget.  Mr. Bradley's aides think it is also essential for him to attract parents and other younger voters in Iowa because they expect senior citizens to vote heavily for Mr. Gore.  Aides to Mr. Gore called Mr. Bradley's education plan incomplete and said the vice president would spend more on education--$ 115 billion over the next decade-- compared with the$ 90 billion Mr. Bradley says he would spend.''\n",

Al Gore is the only presidential candidate to put forth a comprehensive education plan that would be the largest increase in education spending since the G.I.

      "sample_22:  Some Iowa voters seemed to have considered that a dodge, and Mr. Bradley spent much of the first day of his bus tour setting forth his proposals for helping family farmers, as well as criticizing the Clinton administration as not having done enough to help small farmers.  Mr. Gore has made education a major part of his platform, and has argued that Mr. Bradley has offered only incremental ideas on improving education.  In response, Mr. Bradley has begun talking more often about education.\n",

People appeared to have less fixed opinions of Mr. Bradley, but many said they liked him because he seemed to be a fresher face than Mr. Gore and was not burdened by the Clinton connection.  Jim Kurtz, a 35-year-old air traffic controller at Logan Airport in Boston, said that he was torn between Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain but that the governor might be more desirable because of his family background.''\n",

And at the moment, at least, Vice President Al Gore seems to enjoy a commanding advantage with African-American voters, despite former Senator Bill Bradley's passionate commitment to the cause of improving race relations.  Public opinion polls, lists of endorsements and interviews with dozens of Democratic strategists and black political leaders all suggest that Mr. Gore holds a distinct early lead over Mr. Bradley among black voters in states like Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.\n",
      "sample_6:  And in each of those places, political history suggests that black voters could make up a significant share of the electorate, particularly in states where competitive Republican primaries may drain white voters from the Democratic contests.  Mr. Gore, who will deliver remarks at the annual Martin Luther King Jr. holiday commemoration at the Ebenezer Baptist Church here on Monday, is counting on black voters in the South to provide a firewall of protection against the possibility of an early loss in New Hampshire, where some recent polls show Mr. Bradley with a narrow lead.

But in the pursuit of black votes, Mr. Gore holds a card that seems to trump Mr. Bradley's oratorical outreach: the vice presidency.  If Mr. Gore's ties to President Clinton have hurt him with some voters, they are an enormous asset among blacks.\n",
      "sample_17:  For seven years, Mr. Gore has played loyal lieutenant to a president who remains immensely popular with black Americans, and he has used his office to champion causes, bestow access, deliver federal aid and raise political funds for black officials across the country.  Those leaders are now rewarding Mr. Gore's efforts, often emphasizing that they hold nothing against Mr. Bradley but have little reason to look beyond the vice president.  In interview after interview this week, black political leaders explained their support for Mr. Gore by citing the Clinton administration's appointment of black officials, its economic successes and its support for cities and affirmative action.\n",

That was key in terms of Clinton's strategy, and it's one of the reasons why I really do n't think, unless Gore has some kind of meltdown, that Bill Bradley has any chance of beating Al Gore,'' said David A. Bositis, an expert on black voting trends with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.  Three recent national polls all showed that blacks favored Mr. Gore over Mr. Bradley by margins of between two and three to one.\n",

In order for blacks to take a second look at Bradley, not only would he have to have momentum but he would have to blow Gore out in the early states,'' Mr. Lester said.''

Al Gore has devoted a good portion of his career to making prescription drugs more accessible and more affordable while Senator Bradley has taken a lot of money from the New Jersey pharmaceutical companies and represented their interests.''

In the 1996 presidential election alone, drug company employees donated$ 94,325 to the Clinton-Gore committee-- almost as much as Mr. Gore says Mr. Bradley received in his three Senate campaigns.  Pharmaceutical employees donated$ 36,000 to the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign.\n",

In addition, election commission records show that pharmaceutical manufacturers gave the Democratic Party$ 2.3 million in unrestricted soft money donations for the 1996 campaign and$ 829,000 for the 1992 campaign, some of which almost certainly benefited the Clinton-Gore ticket by paying for political advertising, polling and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n",

Officials in the pharmaceutical industry said Mr. Bradley had been responsive to their concerns, but they dismissed Mr. Gore's attacks as campaign posturing.  They said that Mr. Bradley had not consulted them before announcing his health care plan and expressed concern that it could lead to price controls on prescription drugs-- a move they consider the greatest threat government poses to their industry.''\n",

It was one of the most exciting Super Bowls ever, culminating a year in which no-name players like Warner turned from pumpkins to Pro Bowlers and nontraditional teams like the Titans and the Rams went from embarrassment to being championship contenders.

The Kremlin at one point said it would work with moderate Chechen leaders to strengthen the uneasy peace that followed the 1994-1996 conflict between the rebels and Russia, a peace that gave Chechnya near-autonomy.

Mrs. Obraztsova, 53, a researcher at a medical-technical institute, has counseled thousands of mothers on how to get their 18- to 27-year-old sons out of Russia's twice-yearly draft, guiding them through the maze of draft laws, past a hostile military that has resisted the concept of alternative service, and around the increased pressure created by two bloody wars in Chechnya.

Days after Islamic rebels from the breakaway region of Chechnya staged an armed invasion of a neighboring Russian region, Mr. Yeltsin seized the movement to pick his sixth prime minister and heir apparent, Mr. Putin, who was then a member of the Kremlin administration and head of Russia's domestic intelligence service.

As the barrage continued, thousands of refugees poured out of Chechnya, many of them northward in a safe-passage corridor, others through the Caucasus mountains toward Russia's neighbor, Georgia.

      "sample_56:  Stan Fitzgerald, 44, a systems analyst with the Principal Financial Group, said he planned to vote for Mr. Gore at a caucus, even though he thought the vice president might well lose to Mr. Bush in the general election.  On the face of things, Mr. Bush seems to have little to fear from Mr. Forbes here, and his main rival in New Hampshire, Senator John McCain of Arizona, is skipping Iowa-- a tactic that has often backfired in the past.  Mr. Forbes trails badly in all the polls.\n",
      "sample_63:  If someone aborts a child, it's called a choice.''  Mr. Forbes is relying heavily on television; he outspent Mr. Bush last year by three to two But neither he nor the other Republican candidates-- Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes and Gary L. Bauer-- have been able to deny Mr. Bush the support of some of the major leaders of the state's powerful anti-abortion forces.  Ione Dilley and Paul Carbone, two influential figures, have sided with the Texan, though others have thrown their support elsewhere.''\n",
      "sample_70:  Mr. Forbes's not-so-secret weapon is his organization, which Professor Winebrenner called'' one of the best I've ever seen.''  His aides are also playing the expectations game, suggesting that Mr. Bush needs to get at least half the vote to be considered a winner-- no easy target, of course, with so many candidates.  But Iowa results can take odd bounces.\n",

      "sample_3:  Mr. Kemp's endorsement, announced at a news conference in Nashua, N.H., underscored the degree to which members of the Republican establishment, no matter what their divergent views, have coalesced around Mr. Bush in the party's desire to win the White House.  It was also an embarrassment for Mr. Bush's rival Steve Forbes, who had won Mr. Kemp's endorsement in the 1996 primary campaign before Bob Dole picked Mr. Kemp to be his running mate.  Mr. Kemp had been one of the early advocates of the flat income tax, which is central to the Forbes campaign.\n",

Since he's endorsed the principle of the flat tax, why does he go with the weak compromise,'' Mr. Forbes continued, referring to Mr. Bush's tax cut plan.''  If you start watering things down, it will lead to nothing at the end of the day.''\n",
      "sample_30:  If not, we wo n't.''  Asked whether Mr. Bush's message would lead to defeat in November, Mr. Forbes replied:'' Clearly, that's the direction that he's headed.  You see he's putting out muffled messages on the tax code, the life issue, on Social Security.\n",

      "sample_3:  But the day did not start out particularly well.  The Des Moines Register carried its endorsement of George W. Bush and published a recent poll showing that Mr. Forbes, who has spent more than$ 25 million on his current presidential bid, has not budged from the 20 percent standing in the polls.  At an appearance before around 170 people at Iowa State University here, Mr. Forbes reiterated his opposition to abortion and called again for lower taxes.\n",
      "sample_7:  It was also a day of high political theater.  At a press conference after his appearance, Mr. Forbes accused the Bush campaign of calling Forbes supporters and forwarding the calls to a'' pro-abortion group that is tacitly supporting Bush and they do a job on me,'' Mr. Forbes said.  Mr. Forbes identified that group as the Republican Leadership Council, an independent liberal Republican group.''\n",

An editorial in the Feb. 21 issue of The National Review, a conservative magazine that has championed Mr. Forbes, called for him to quit.''\n",

The theory is that the longer Mr. Forbes stays in, the more he takes votes from Mr. Bush, forcing Mr. Bush to engage in distracting and costly battles.  In Iowa, for instance, Mr. Forbes's fiery anti-abortion talk raised an issue Mr. Bush would have preferred to avoid and resulted in Mr. Bush's responding with a hard-line anti-abortion position that could cost him moderate votes in the fall, should Mr. Bush be the Republican Party nominee.\n",

Mr. Bush, who also has waged an aggressive drive, is trying to beat back an unflagging challenge from Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher who has built a vast organization in Iowa.  Mr. Bush's supporters also hope that an impressive showing on Monday will help him halt any surge in New Hampshire for Senator John McCain of Arizona.\n",

Mr. Bush, too, has been pressed about abortion in the last few days, in part because of statements that Mr. Forbes has made on the stump.

The dynamic between the candidates had clearly been altered by the results of the Iowa caucuses, in which Mr. Bush finished first, but the second-place finish of Mr. Forbes and third-place finish of Alan Keyes were both surprisingly strong.

And despite the best efforts of Mr. Sharpton and Mrs. Clinton's aides to arrange the appearance to Mr. Giuliani's disadvantage-- in a show of party solidarity, she was accompanied on the stage by two formerly quarreling mayors, Edward I.
