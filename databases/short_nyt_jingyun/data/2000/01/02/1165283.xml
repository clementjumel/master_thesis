        <p>The Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation has come to the rescue of Connecticut parishioners searching for a church-steeple repairman -- and everyone else who needs to find help to do restoration work.</p>
        <p>As a guide to homeowners and others concerned with the preservation of old buildings, the trust has published a list of contractors and other professionals in restoration, which it says is the first and only such publication in the state.</p>
        <p>It gives the names and a descriptive paragraph on such specialists as building movers, historic-preservation consultants, millworkers, cabinetmakers, antiques and stained-glass restorers -- and church steeple restorers.</p>
        <p>The trust says that it receives hundreds of telephone calls every year from people who have such questions as ''Who can help me restore a crumbling 18th-century chimney?'' and ''Should I use vinyl siding to replace my cracked clapboard?'' The directory will presumably forestall these phone calls.</p>
        <p>The directory costs $10 ($7.50 for trust members) plus shipping costs.</p>
        <p>The trust can be reached by telephone at (203) 562-6312, by fax at (203) 773-0107 or by e-mail at directory@cttrust.org.</p>
