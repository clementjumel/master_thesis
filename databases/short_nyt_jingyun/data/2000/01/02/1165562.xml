        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In a broad critique of American's unions (''A New Idea for Unions: Forget the Past,'' On the Contrary, Dec. 5) Daniel Akst was right when he said that labor unions, to be truly progressive and relevant, have to expand the repertoire of services they offer to prospective members and find ways to adjust to the emerging new work force and globalization.</p>
        <p>But he was wrong to suggest that workers have lost interest in unions. Though only one in seven workers is a union member, surveys have  shown that roughly one-third of all nonunion workers want to be represented by unions in dealing with employers.</p>
        <p>The problem is that they are not often given that choice. Most unions have been reluctant to use their resources to organize new members (and still are, despite their leaders' rhetoric). The typical employer fights union organizing campaigns with tactics like legal delays and intimidation of union supporters.  And labor laws make organizing difficult, time-consuming and expensive because they require elections, not membership cards, to prove union support.</p>
