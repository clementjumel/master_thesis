        <p>Anyone who was once a Beatle, even the ''quiet'' one, can never fade away and live a simple life -- no matter how big the mansion, how high the walls. George Harrison learned that in a spasm of violence, one with echoes of John Lennon's murder nearly two decades ago.</p>
        <p>An intruder -- obsessed with the Beatles to the point of believing they were witches -- broke into his home outside London and stabbed him in the chest, also slightly injuring his wife, Olivia. Mr. Harrison should recover from the resulting lung injury, his surgeon said, in a matter of weeks.</p>
