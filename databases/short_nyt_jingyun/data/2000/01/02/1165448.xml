        <p>I'd like to thank Mayor Tom Suozzi of Glen Cove for his most generous holiday gifts. He has given more to our community than anyone I can remember. And the gambling ferries he is bringing to Hempstead Harbor [''Glen Cove Still Suitor for Foxwoods Ferry,'' Nov. 21] are gifts that will keep on giving.</p>
        <p>To their engines we'll listen. How their fuel slicks will glisten!</p>

        <p>I'd like to thank Mayor Tom Suozzi of Glen Cove for his most generous holiday gifts. He has given more to our community than anyone I can remember. And the gambling ferries he is bringing to Hempstead Harbor [''Glen Cove Still Suitor for Foxwoods Ferry,'' Nov. 21] are gifts that will keep on giving.</p>
        <p>To their engines we'll listen. How their fuel slicks will glisten!</p>
        <p>The ferry parking lot lights will shine so bright, folks won't know if it's day or night.</p>
        <p>Our small streets and roads, the added cars and buses will overload.</p>
        <p>No more boating or canoeing or swimming, thanks to the unsafe conditions his bringing.</p>
        <p>Nearby towns and villages are so grateful that in his decisions he is so faithful.</p>
        <p>There will be only four boats, he was heard to say. Now we know there will be eight a day.</p>
        <p>This deal he pushed through -- he really did scurry, saying to all, ''Don't worry.'' We'd like to know, what was his hurry?</p>
        <p>Was his plan to not give people time to think, so his project wouldn't sink?</p>
        <p>On Jan. 15, the ferries will start. People living in surrounding towns and villages are saying, in this we want no part.</p>
        <p>He might also take note, we are citizens, and we vote.</p>
