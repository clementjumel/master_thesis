        <p>With flashing strobe lights, hovering helicopters and a typically atomized approach, Los Angeles said goodbye to the 20th century this morning in a celebration that fell short of its own aims, dampened by rain and by Southern California's seeming inability to get too awfully excited about anything.</p>
        <p>As darkness fell, the designated municipal icon, the HOLLYWOOD sign, glowed a midnight blue in the hills above the sprawling metropolis, and as midnight neared, its letters flashed periodically in streaks of blue and white, like so much psychedelic marbleized fudge. Moments before the stroke of midnight, Mayor Richard J. Riordan and Jay Leno flipped a switch that sent the sign flashing into shifting shades of purple, yellow, red and orange, with white flashing strobes outlining its edges.</p>

        <p>With flashing strobe lights, hovering helicopters and a typically atomized approach, Los Angeles said goodbye to the 20th century this morning in a celebration that fell short of its own aims, dampened by rain and by Southern California's seeming inability to get too awfully excited about anything.</p>
        <p>As darkness fell, the designated municipal icon, the HOLLYWOOD sign, glowed a midnight blue in the hills above the sprawling metropolis, and as midnight neared, its letters flashed periodically in streaks of blue and white, like so much psychedelic marbleized fudge. Moments before the stroke of midnight, Mayor Richard J. Riordan and Jay Leno flipped a switch that sent the sign flashing into shifting shades of purple, yellow, red and orange, with white flashing strobes outlining its edges.</p>
        <p>But even local television stations seemed to give as much attention to the sloshing fountains of Las Vegas, apparently underwhelmed by their own city's stab at civic iconography. And revelers gathered on the rooftops of the 70-year-old residential subdivision that the Hollywood sign was built to advertise, kept waiting for a promised spectacle that never quite materialized.</p>
        <p>In sum, the celebration seemed proof positive that Los Angeles lacks the sort of public gathering place that defines a New York or London, and the sign-lighting itself remained a largely private affair, since homeowners in the neighborhoods around it had protested the plan and the police set up a network of multiple checkpoints to keep all but residents and their invited guests from driving into the network of canyons with the best views. Horns and cheers rang out from a few dozen houses, but there was nothing like the huge gathering in Times Square.</p>
        <p>Though city officials fielded what they called the largest police operation in Los Angeles history, there were no reports of serious trouble, and Southern California Edison, which supplies power to 11 million people in 10 counties, said that there was a greater risk of electricity problems caused by drunken drivers hitting utility poles than by any problems in computer programs governing the power grids.</p>
        <p>The festivities got under way Friday afternoon with a musical celebration dubbed Opus 21, in which churches, choirs and other groups began a simultaneous sounding of bells, cymbals, gongs and shofars to start the celebration. But by midafternoon, pouring rain and spotty street flooding had scattered a crowd of several hundred people from Grand Avenue downtown, where the theme was ''The Global Village,'' with a sort of street fair featuring face-painters, a Ferris wheel and considerably fewer than the 2,000 marching band members that had been promised.</p>
        <p>''So far, so good,'' said Linda Miller, who came from nearby Torrance, Calif., with her husband, Dave, to watch their daughter march in the band.</p>
        <p>''I kind of wish it didn't have to rain,'' she said. Surveying the crowd, she added: ''It's a little thin. I think they were a little light on the advertising.''</p>
        <p>A few blocks away, on Olvera Street, the site of the city's original Spanish settlement, crowds were thicker.</p>
        <p>But by night's end, police officers in the city's official command center were downing deli sandwiches and complaining of an unexpected challenge: boredom.</p>
