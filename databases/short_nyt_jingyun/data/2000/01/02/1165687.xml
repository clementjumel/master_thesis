        <p>MEIER-June. On December 26, 1999. Wife of the late Frank Meier. Mother of Diane, Gordon and Richard. Grandmother of Bennett, Bradford, Rebecca and John. As master-craftsman, teacher and advocate, she helped to rediscover and resurrect lost decorative arts from decoupage to all manner of painted finishes and taught a new generation to appreciate the beauty of the past and weave it into the context of the present. In lieu of flowers, please make donations to The Isabel O'Neil Foundation for the Art of the Painted Finish. A private memorial service is being planned.</p>
