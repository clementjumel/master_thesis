        <p>Had he envisioned the modern-day legal system, Shakespeare might have thought twice before so cavalierly asking, ''What's in a name?''</p>
        <p>That's what Chicago's Silverberg brothers and Michael Jordan, the basketball legend, are fighting over. As of early last week, Michael Jordan's Restaurant on Chicago's La Salle Street, owned by Gene H. and Joe Silverberg, is closed, but boy, does the memory linger on.</p>
        <p>In 1990, Mr. Jordan agreed to give the Silverbergs the sole right to use his name on a Chicago restaurant. After a few good years, business tailed off, and a lot of suing began.</p>
        <p>The Silverbergs have repeatedly accused Mr. Jordan of ''abandoning'' the restaurant by refusing to make frequent appearances, and of unreasonably blocking a move to the Palmer House Hotel. Mr. Jordan's lawyers counter that he was never obliged to visit, that he and his family were harassed when they did, and that the Palmer House is in a weaker location.</p>
        <p>Complicating the dispute, Mr. Jordan is a partner in One Sixtyblue, a more upscale eatery two miles away. Mr. Jordan's name and athletic paraphernalia are nowhere to be seen there, but the Silverbergs contend that One Sixtyblue infringes on their exclusive rights, and said so in a court hearing Tuesday. The Jordan camp said the Silverbergs had publicly denigrated Mr. Jordan in violation of their contract.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordan is having an easier time in New York, with a steak house in Grand Central Terminal that he partly owns but rarely visits.</p>
        <p>The Silverbergs have said they will reopen soon, using the name of a new hero, Sammy Sosa.</p>
