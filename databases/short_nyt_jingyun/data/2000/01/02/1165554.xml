        <p>If one bit of history is any guide, you might be wise to avoid Amazon.com stock in 2000.</p>
        <p>Call it the curse of being named person of the year by Time magazine, which for 1999 picked Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder of Amazon, the money-losing Internet retailer that the market thinks is worth $27 billion.</p>
        <p>Consider that Walter P. Chrysler was Time's man for 1928; the next year, the whole market crashed, Chrysler by 78 percent. Undeterred, Time chose Owen D. Young, chairman of General Electric, in 1929, for his role in negotiating World War I debt settlements. G.E. stock skidded 18 percent in 1930.</p>
        <p>Later, Harlow H. Curtice of General Motors saw his stock decline 4 percent in 1956, and Ted Turner's eponymous broadcasting company lost 16 percent in 1992.</p>
        <p>Only one executive has ducked the curse, not unlike the one that haunts athletes featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Intel stock rose 69 percent in 1998, after Andrew S. Grove was featured.</p>
