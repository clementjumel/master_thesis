        <p>He was refused bail a second time, but not before the hearing was turned into a mini-trial of both Dr. Lee and the security at government weapons labs.</p>

        <p>On the surface, the hearings in the case of Wen Ho Lee, the scientist accused of mishandling sensitive nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, were simple. Dr. Lee sought to be released on bail.</p>
        <p>He was refused bail a second time, but not before the hearing was turned into a mini-trial of both Dr. Lee and the security at government weapons labs.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors called Dr. Lee devious in his efforts to bypass security precautions.</p>
        <p>The defense, however, showed that Dr. Lee had downloaded the secret data easily onto computer tapes, had left evidence in the open and had even called the lab to ask how to delete some files. The last was an act that prosecutors called especially nefarious.</p>
