        <p>WHEN Boris N. Yeltsin unveiled his millennium surprise on New Year's Eve, he used the word ''power'' five times in his brief retirement speech.</p>
        <p>When Lenin issued his famous call to power on Oct. 24, 1917, he also used the word ''power'' five times. Lenin was getting ready to seize it. Mr. Yeltsin, who will go down in history as the man who toppled the totalitarian system Lenin wrought, said he was relinquishing it.</p>
        <p>Yet power, and the thirst for it, is the connection between two Russian leaders who only a few years ago symbolized opposite extremes.</p>
        <p>As was clear from the moment he mentioned his anointed successor, Vladimir Putin (''I have no doubt what choice you will make at the end of March 2000'' ), Mr. Yeltsin left office not to protect the fragile democracy that brought about his election in 1992, but to preserve the power that his administration came to revere above all else.</p>
        <p>As political theater, it was a classic Yeltsin move -- unpredictable but shrewd. Mr. Yeltsin no doubt realized that Mr. Putin's surge in popularity, based on public support for a military crackdown in Chechnya, might not last until June, when elections were supposed to take place. By then enough soldiers will have come home in body bags to contradict the promise of a clean, easy victory -- as they did the last time Mr. Yeltsin tried to impose Russian might on the rebel republic.</p>
        <p>''Why hold on to power for another six months?'' Mr. Yeltsin said, with a straight face. ''No, this is not me, this is not in my character,''</p>
        <p>Holding on to power, against all odds, has been the one steady feature of Mr. Yeltsin's remarkably inconsistent tenure as president. And that too is not all that surprising. Power has been the driving force of Russian politics since the time of the czars, through the Soviet Union and beyond. For all the mistakes and misjudgments that Mr. Yeltsin conceded and regretted, he never lost sight of what matters in Russia. Russians have been so crushed for so long that they have learned to respond only to an iron fist, and Mr. Yeltsin played to that instinct again and again, taking on the role of the autocrat as nimbly as he had turned himself into a democrat when the Soviet Empire began to topple.</p>
        <p>Over the past few years, the West has mainly seen Mr. Yeltsin through the prism of news clips, embarrassing shots of him toppling over at official ceremonies, frugging at a rock concert or recovering from heart surgery in a government dacha. Russians have also seen him act out rituals that date to the czars, shaking his finger at quaking local bureaucrats, ordering them to raise wages that Moscow had already cut back.</p>
        <p>He came to public notice in the late 1980's as a populist who rode public buses and hectored party officials, but he seamlessly recast himself as an age-old Kremlin ruler, surrounded by sycophants and bodyguards, allowing corruption to flourish at the highest levels.</p>
        <p>DURING the coup of 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin stood on a tank to defy the old Soviet guard into history, he created one of the most electrifying moments in the recent past.</p>
        <p>But when he took over, he ruled by contradiction. He fired scores of advisers, rehired many and fired them again -- and again.</p>
        <p>Anatoly Chubais, a former deputy prime minister who is viewed by the West as the last guarantor of free-market rules, was kicked in and out of power. So was Boris Berezovsky, the crafty tycoon who symbolizes the entrenched business interests that want to impose their own rule on the Russian market. Mr. Yeltsin deserves credit for seeking to introduce real economic freedom in a country that never experienced it,  but he will also be remembered as the ruler who oversaw the birth of Russia's plutocracy.</p>
        <p>He will get credit for leaving the Kremlin voluntarily, something no one in Russian history had ever done, except Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- at a time when Mr. Yeltsin had the upper hand and had left him no choice.</p>
        <p>But this was not like a broken Lyndon Johnson refusing to run for a second term. Mr. Yeltsin wants to be succeeded by someone whose loyalty will last and will not hound him in retirement with criminal charges, financial restraints or just lese majeste. Mr. Putin remains unproven as a leader. For now, he mainly represents Mr. Yeltsin's desire to keep his grip on Russia's future - and preserve his own.</p>
        <p>Or, as Lenin put it in 1917, ''the seizure of power is the business of the uprising; its political purpose will become clear after the seizure.''</p>
