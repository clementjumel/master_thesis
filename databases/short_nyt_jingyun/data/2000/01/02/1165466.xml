        <p>Treading through a museum can the price one pays for elucidation and inspiration. But at the Morris Museum, the walk is the attraction itself -- if you can find your way out. It is the Amazing Maze, at The Morris Museum now through Feb. 13.</p>
        <p>On loan from the New York Hall of Science in Queens, the 2,304-square-foot maze means to provide a challenge puzzle to those who want to try to find their way through the orange and blue structure, said Paula Hunchar, museum director of development.</p>
        <p>''We are an arts, science and humanities museum, so this fits with our mission,'' said Ms. Hunchar. ''Mazes are mysterious and fun. This is an interactive experience designed to be challenging for children and fun for adults. It helps people learn to solve problems.''</p>
