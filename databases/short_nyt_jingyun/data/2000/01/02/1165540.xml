        <p>Emma Woodhouse learned the hard way about the dangers of makeovers. She tried to turn her simple friend, Harriet Smith, into a girl with airs and aspirations. Too late, Jane Austen's heroine realized she had altered Harriet for the worse, from humble to vain.</p>
        <p>Literature is rife with cautionary tales about experiments in identity -- from Dorian Gray to Jay Gatsby to Tom Ripley, whose murderous motto is ''Better a fake somebody than a real nobody.''</p>
        <p>And yet, as we head into Clinton 2000, the vertiginous story line remains the same: a carnival of makeovers, with inconstancy all that is constant.</p>
        <p>As President Clinton did a round of TV interviews last week to try to give his image one more face-lift, Linda and Monica sashayed back onto the stage to flaunt their own transformations. And to add to the craziness, Hillary, the woman of a thousand faces, was displaying her dueling identities: first lady being hugged by the president at the millennium kick-off ceremony and New York Senate candidate whose best campaign move would be to dump the guy.</p>
        <p>You almost had to feel sorry for the Proteus in Chief. He tried to go deep and look far with Charlie Rose on ''60 Minutes II,'' talking about biomedical advances and the human genome project, musing about 2050: ''What's this world going to look like?''</p>
        <p>But while the president wondered what the world would look like, the world wondered what Monica and Linda would look like. A slimmed-down Ms. Lewinsky is starting her new career as a huckster for Jenny Craig, which fattened the company's stock by 37 percent.</p>
        <p>And, perhaps inspired by Paula Jones's exciting new nose, Mrs. Tripp unveiled her exciting new head.</p>
        <p>How weird: a scandal that investigated whether the president was treating women as sex objects has ended with most of the women involved getting makeovers to look sexier.</p>
        <p>It was a shock, after Mrs. Tripp  blessedly disappeared for several months, to learn that she was just getting ready for her close-up. With her utterly transformed visage and dark hair, she recalled those mobsters who have to get new faces after they turn rat finks.</p>
        <p>''It looks like she's had a head transplant,'' Lucianne Goldberg told The New York Post, which was reporting on a new National Enquirer story.</p>
        <p>Friends said that Mrs. Tripp, who was hurt by being portrayed by John Goodman in a wig on ''Saturday Night Live,'' just wanted to be pretty. David Letterman conceded the surgery had done wonders: ''She looks like a new man.''</p>
        <p>The moral is one Jane Austen would appreciate: ugly is as ugly does.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tripp released a statement on Friday saying that the head-to-toe surgery and liposuction, performed by a Beverly Hills knife-artist, was paid for by an unidentified private donor who sympathized with her over the biting parodies.</p>
        <p>''She just didn't feel good about herself and felt she could feel a lot better and this is what she went and did,'' Bob Angelotti, a Tripp spokesman, told The A.P.</p>
        <p>This woman nearly topples the republic and all she needs to feel better about herself is fat vacuuming?</p>
        <p>The impeachment chaos now boils down to three fashion questions: Is there still a waiting list at Club Monaco for Monica's lip gloss color? Were her online totes all sold out for Christmas? How much weight has she lost?</p>
        <p>Before Monica, it was considered retro to openly discuss the weight and appearance of women. The day after her testimony at a hearing in Maryland in Mrs. Tripp's wiretap case, The Washington Post ran a story that began with what it considered to be the essential fact: ''Thirty pounds.''</p>
        <p>And at a Washington cocktail party last week, a gaggle of guests talking to Kenneth Starr blithely speculated about the number of pounds the former intern had shed.</p>
        <p>We all believe in second acts and second chances -- even third ones. We all believe in self-improvement. We all believe in the possibility of genuine change and true conversion.</p>
        <p>But this crowd has given personal development a bad name. The problem is not metamorphosis. The problem is tactical and tacky metamorphosis.</p>
        <p>All the signals of American culture notwithstanding, the answer is not to be found in appearances.</p>
