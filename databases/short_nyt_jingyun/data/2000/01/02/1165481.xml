        <p>IN 1942, in the face of the bloody tyrannies and colonial empires that covered nearly the entire globe, Aaron Copland composed ''Fanfare for the Common Man.'' How defiant, even naive, it looked then. How prescient it looks now.</p>
        <p>For all the real power that political rulers, corporate masters and technological forces have over our lives, the century just ended (I know, I know: supposedly another year to go) was shaped more than anything else by the passions and desires of millions upon millions of ordinary men and women.</p>
        <p>Think how unprecedented that was. Before 1900, the middle class in Europe and the United States was a relative drop in the bucket -- mostly small merchants and a sprinkling of professionals; it scarcely existed elsewhere in the world. Few industrial workers earned a living wage. The largest group of people, even in the most advanced countries, still worked the land from dawn to dusk. Domestic servants of the rich were another big part of the work force.</p>
        <p>Aristocracies and caste systems were the order of the day. Genuinely representative democracy existed in only a handful of countries, and even in those, all women and many men, including nearly all blacks in the United States, were barred from voting.</p>
        <p>For all our worries today about economic inequality, wealth in the era before World War I was really concentrated. ''In the half-century before 1914, most capital flows traced back to a few thousand wealthy European families,'' David Hale, chief global economist for Zurich Financial Services in Chicago, recently wrote. ''Today they are driven by fund managers allocating the savings of hundreds of millions of people in pension funds and mutual funds.''</p>
        <p>WHAT brought about this revolutionary change, in which workers themselves came to own much of the means of production? Many things, of course, including the spread of democratic practices and public education. And one product above all others powered this transformation: the automobile, built on a moving assembly line.</p>
        <p>At the turn of the century, the horseless carriage was widely derided: contemporary observers said it was simply a plaything for the rich, a machine to impress the ladies. But in 1908, Henry Ford introduced the Model T. And in paying his workers what was then the princely wage of $5 a day to make a car selling for $850, he helped create a consumer mass market at the same time he was offering something to satisfy it. The combination released a torrent.</p>
        <p>''The mass-production automobile broke all the traditional boundaries that held people in place,'' said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and author of ''The Prize,'' a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the oil industry. ''Everywhere you go, it represents independence, mobility, freedom.''</p>
        <p>So, before we bury the 20th century, let us praise its essential icon. For despite the environmental ills that cars have brought in their exhaust trail, nothing else so represents the empowerment of ordinary people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford knew exactly what he was after. ''I will build a motor car for the great multitude,'' he said, ''constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise.'' It would be, he added, ''so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one and enjoy with his family the blessings of hours of pleasure in God's great open spaces.''</p>
        <p>Well, maybe he miscalculated a bit on the open spaces. Our bottomless demand to own and drive automobiles has transformed the landscape almost beyond recognition, inexorably producing the highways we crowd onto and the suburbs where most of us in America now choose to live.</p>
        <p>For all the attention devoted to computers and the Internet, the auto industry still defies comparison. Roughly 7.5 million people, about 6 percent of the American work force, are involved in building, selling or repairing cars and light trucks, almost four times as many as are employed by all electronics and computer makers. Three of the four largest companies in the nation by sales -- General Motors, Ford and Exxon Mobil -- make cars or fuel them. In 1999, Americans bought a record 17 million of the vehicles.</p>
        <p>The phenomenon is global; there are more than 550 million cars around the world. Americans own the most -- one car for every 1.7 residents -- but even in crowded Japan there is one for every 2.1 people, and there is one for every 5.3 Britons.</p>
        <p>Do all these automobiles represent too much of a good thing? Perhaps, but good luck persuading people to stop buying them. No matter what is done in the form of taxes or regulation to discourage their use, as soon as incomes in any nation reach a certain level -- on average, around $6,000 a person -- sales of cars invariably skyrocket.</p>
        <p>In the United States, higher gasoline taxes would at least encourage the production of more efficient autos and slightly restrain driving. New technologies, like electric/internal-combustion hybrids and, eventually, fuel cells, should help further reduce the air pollution they cause. But don't expect more.</p>
        <p>As long as democracy and free markets persist, personal transportation in some form will be ubiquitous. Why? Because that's the way we want it.</p>
