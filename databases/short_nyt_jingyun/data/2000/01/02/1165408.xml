        <p>THE Brockholst, built in 1890 at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue, is something of a poor man's Dakota -- lesser in all respects than the famous apartment house farther south, but still majestically craggy, with wide, rambling marble-paneled halls and some of the most interesting apartments on the West Side.

        <p>The six-story gingerbread-colored building was designed in 1889 by John G. Prague, a prolific West Side row house architect who owned the building with a partner, Thomas E. D. Power.

        <p>THE Brockholst, built in 1890 at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue, is something of a poor man's Dakota -- lesser in all respects than the famous apartment house farther south, but still majestically craggy, with wide, rambling marble-paneled halls and some of the most interesting apartments on the West Side. When Marcus Retter bought the Romanesque revival building nearly half a century ago, the West Side was headed downhill. But now the neighborhood -- and the Brockholst -- are on the way up.</p>
        <p>The six-story gingerbread-colored building was designed in 1889 by John G. Prague, a prolific West Side row house architect who owned the building with a partner, Thomas E. D. Power. Along with other investors, Prague and Power built 232 row houses in the area from 85th to 87th Streets and from Columbus Avenue to Amsterdam Avenue, creating an entire community where, in the mid-1880's, there had been only open land.</p>
        <p>An 1890 issue of The Real Estate Record &amp; Guide, a trade magazine, called the $250,000 Brockholst ''truly noble,'' with an interior ''such as one would expect to see in one of the old English castles.'' The lobby ceiling was decorated with aluminum leaf by Tiffany &amp; Company, and two dining rooms, a cafe and a barbershop served tenants and passers-by. Most of the 32 apartments had three bedrooms and rented for $125 a month. They had gas and electric lighting, and Wilton carpets in the hallways.</p>
        <p>The earliest tenants were prosperous leaders in the mining, brokerage, printing and fancy-goods businesses. But a 1917 article in Building Management, another trade magazine, noted that rents had declined to $75 a month; at that time, dinner in the restaurant could be had for 75 cents, and full board was $10 a week.</p>
        <p>By the 1920's, when the Brockholst had been eclipsed by more advanced buildings, a more varied group of tenants had moved in. They included Margaret Beecher White, a Christian Science practitioner who lived there with her mother, Harriet Beecher, daughter of the controversial Brooklyn preacher Henry Ward Beecher.</p>
        <p>Another was Katherine Devereux Blake, who spoke widely on the peace movement, women's rights and education, and was principal of Public School 6 for many years when it was at 85th Street and Madison Avenue. Hilda Englund, the Swedish-born actress well known for performing in the plays of Henrik Ibsen, also lived there, and the census returns for the 1920's show occupations like ''manager-musical,'' ''artist-painter'' and ''writer-literary critic'' among the lodgers in the informally subdivided apartments.</p>
        <p>By the 1950's, the dining rooms had been replaced by stores on the Columbus Avenue side, cornice and trim details had been removed and ''the West Side was very much on a downward movement -- people wanted to move to Westchester, Long Island and New Jersey,'' said Mr. Retter, who was head of the group that bought the building in 1956. His father-in-law, Charles Rosen, was the principal partner.</p>
        <p>IN March 1939, as a teenager, Mr. Retter fled Vienna for England. He had hoped that his parents would follow, ''but they were with the unlucky ones -- they were deported to Riga and gassed,'' he said from his office at 88th Street and Riverside Drive.  His desk is awash in papers, and his own office has a 1960's I.B.M. electric typewriter and an old adding machine, although his employees work at computers.</p>
        <p>In the early 1940's, Mr. Retter was an assistant to Lord Josiah Wedgewood, a Labor member of the British Parliament, while Winston Churchill was prime minister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Retter easily imitates Churchill's stance and diction, which he observed during their wartime meetings. After the war, he came to the United States and assembled a group of real estate investors. He saw that the West Side was in rocky shape, ''but it was solid,'' he said, his voice slightly layered with his native German and the English accent he acquired in the 1940's. His group assembled a considerable portfolio of buildings, which has at times included the Eldorado on Central Park West and 90th Street, 640 West End Avenue and 425 Riverside Drive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Retter said that when he bought the Brockholst he had planned to divide the large apartments into smaller units, but that plan was too expensive, and so most of the large apartments remain intact. The rent on these apartments was about $300 a month in the 1950's; now, he estimates that the market rent is $2,500 a month.</p>
        <p>In the last few years Mr. Retter has installed new windows throughout the building, and he is now creating a three-bedroom roof duplex, designed by his regular architects, Feingold &amp; Gregory, for one of the top-floor apartments.</p>
        <p>The Brockholst is in the Central Park West Historic District, and Paul Gregory, a partner in the architectural firm, said the Landmarks Preservation Commission was eager to have the extension clad in matching brick and one of the window bays extended upward, ''stuff we probably would have done anyway.''</p>
        <p>EXCEPT for those changes, the interior and exterior of the Brockholst are essentially unchanged from the time when Mr. Retter bought it. The lobby has a marble floor and ornate column capitals with the monogram B, but the decorative work has long been painted over. The upper halls are more than six feet wide, with multiple windows providing much better light and ventilation than that available in far more pretentious buildings.</p>
        <p>The apartments, 41 in all, have large doors and high ceilings -- the ceiling in the apartment of Oscar Rivera, the superintendent, is 11 1/2 feet high -- and unusual floor finishes, fireplace mantels and other details. At least one apartment still has intact period kitchen woodwork and cabinets, rare in a building of this age. The trim, doors and floors are worn, but not fatally so -- surprising, given the wear the building has had.</p>
        <p>Outside on 85th Street, the large areaway in front of the Brockholst is intact, adding to its dignity, and the heavily worked iron fencing and other details have a magnificent crust of flaking black paint. Up the weathered facade, large sections of brownstone have fallen away, but much is perfectly intact -- checkerboards, gables, leafy chimney stacks and other details.</p>
        <p>Startling, bright gray mortar recently applied between the bricks on the Columbus Avenue facade will have to be removed and redone. Terri Rosen Deutsch, a spokeswoman for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said that the contractor had been instructed to do test patches to find the correct mortar color, but he proceeded to point the whole wall without the commission's approval.</p>
        <p>Half a century of navigating New York's housing laws has toughened Mr. Retter, and he does not let problems like this one annoy him. The commission, he said, is ''very, very tough, but if you comply, there's no problem -- one can live with them.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  January 16, 2000, Sunday  The Streetscapes column on Jan. 2, about the Brockholst apartment house at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue, misidentified the Landmarks Preservation Commission official who commented on mortar work on a wall. She was Katy McNabb, not Terri Rosen Deutsch.</p>
