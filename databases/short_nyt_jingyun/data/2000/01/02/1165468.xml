        <p>Lynette Denney reveals a lot about herself in her sculpture ''Blind Mother,'' pictured. As a mother and an artist in mid-career, Ms. Denney lost her sight as a result of diabetes. Ms. Denney used her evolving sense of touch and her memory to change her medium from works on canvas to sculpture.</p>
        <p>Ms. Denney is one of 24 visually impaired artists in ''Art of the Eye II,'' which runs through Feb. 18 at the Blair Academy in Blairstown, and includes paintings, sculpture and photography.</p>
        <p>Flo Fox, a photographer with multiple sclerosis, was born without vision in one eye and later became legally blind in the other. She uses automatic focusing features on her camera, which is attached to the arm of her motorized wheelchair, and presses a rubber bulb  between her teeth to activate the shutter. Mary Solbrig, a painter with macular degeneration, an eye disease associated with aging, recently had one of her eyes removed and has 20/400 vision in her remaining eye. She uses hand-held magnifiers to help guide her while painting.</p>

        <p>The show's curator is Scott Nelson, a sculptor with Usher syndrome, with night blindness and tunnel vision among the symptoms. A look at the works in the catalog suggests that seeing things differently is not a handicap, but a catalyst in the creation of visual art. Information: (908) 362-6121.</p>
