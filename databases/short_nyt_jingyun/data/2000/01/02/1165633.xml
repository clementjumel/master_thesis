        <p>Back-to-back storms with gale force winds that reached 120 miles per hour ripped through France and other parts of Europe. The French Ministry of Culture and Communication said it would take more than $60 million just to repair damage to historic monuments like Notre Dame Cathedral, Ste.-Chapelle and the palace at Versailles.</p>
        <p>The storms tore off roofs, toppled thousands of trees and caused flooding and avalanches that killed at least 130 people throughout Europe, 78 of them in France. More than a quarter of Frances electric grid was damaged. One insurance company said the cost of repairing damages from the storms would reach $5 billion.</p>
