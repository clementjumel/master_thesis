        <p>Senator John McCain and former Senator Bill Bradley, the surging presidential challengers, reported surprisingly strong fund-raising totals for the final three months of the year, matching their climbing poll ratings in New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain took in $6.1 million and Mr. Bradley received $8 million, compared with only $4 million for Vice President Gore. Gov. George Bush of Texas continued his dominance of the money chase, collecting $10 million in the fourth quarter of 1999 and entering the 2000 primary season with $31.4 million in the bank.</p>
