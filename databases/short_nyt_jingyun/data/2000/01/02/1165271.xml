        <p>A WINDOW FACING WEST</p>
        <p>By John S. Tarlton.</p>
        <p>Bridge Works, $22.95.</p>
        <p>Gatlin is turning 47 -- the age at which his father finally succeeded at suicide. Gatlin is a smart-talking financial planner from Baton Rouge, and his birthday finds him teetering on the brink of his own mid-life crisis. He loves his wife, Sarah, and their sex life remains more or less fulfilling after 24 years, though the couple is haunted by a series of failed pregnancies. Yet despite his basically pleasant marriage, Gatlin sees his male friends having affairs and he admits that his ''heart is a fetid backwater of unrequited lust.'' In short, he's worried that life is passing him by, and he's looking to recapture a little past glory. Sarah also feels suffocated and wants a change of scenery; her dream is to drop it all and go west -- with or without her husband. Snappy, funny and real, this first novel follows Gatlin on a four-day bender, largely in his own mind, as he comes to terms with what he's lost and learns to recognize how much he's got. Tarlton's emotional accounting eventually dismisses sexual fantasy -- in the person of Madeline, Gatlin's client and the impossibly sexy lover of at least two of his close friends -- as outweighed by a truer sentimental flow: a deep and resilient love. With Sarah, Gatlin finds the redemptive power to move on to year 48 and beyond. Out the bedroom window facing west the world is waiting -- and Gatlin, though he's certain to suffer more doubts, is happy and ready.</p>
