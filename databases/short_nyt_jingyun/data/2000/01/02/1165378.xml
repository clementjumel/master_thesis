        <p>Dick Briglia letter on Herbert Muschamp's Dec 19 (1999) article about Donald Trump as sign that The Times does not embarrass anymore, that anything goes and there is no gatekeeper to curb self-aggrandizing, self-indulgent scribes when they rush off to produce some incomprehensible piece of 'writing' (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The New York Times does not embarrass anymore. Rushing headlong into more, bigger, longer everything -- sections, articles -- The Times is about to implode.

        <p>What is astonishing about The Times nowadays is that anything goes; there are no more gatekeepers. Still, it would seem to me that when one of its scribes is off on some self-aggrandizing, self-indulgent, incomprehensible piece of -- and I hesitate to use the word -- writing, someone on 43rd Street would say: ''O.K., you had your fun, now sit down and write your Sunday article.''</p>
