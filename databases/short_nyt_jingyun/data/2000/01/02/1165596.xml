        <p>Among the more persistent fables in the West is that the pork in seedy Chinese restaurants may actually be the meat of stray cats.</p>
        <p>But some Chinese pay good money to eat cat, in a Cantonese dish called Dragon and Tiger Fight that combines the meat of snakes and cats.</p>
        <p>In the homeland of Cantonese food, the southern province of Guangdong -- where it is said that people will eat anything with four legs except the table -- cat is neither a major item on menus nor a traditional favorite. But a small minority of diners like to order it, and they carry their preferences with them.</p>
        <p>So along with the spread of Cantonese-style restaurants in Beijing in the last few years has come a new problem: cat-nabbing, to supply meat for demanding customers.</p>
        <p>Just since September, as many as 500 Beijing families have had pet cats stolen, said Lu Di, an elderly Beijing woman who has long been a lonely campaigner for animal welfare here. There is no way to confirm her estimate, which she extrapolated from complaints that her Association for the Protection of Small Animals has heard from cat owners.</p>
        <p>''We must take concrete measures to stop this barbarian behavior,'' said Ms. Lu, who is also a professor of classical literature at People's University. Her expanding national association -- which claims a membership of 5,000, including pet lovers, veterinarians and scientists -- is demanding that the police take stronger measures to combat the theft.</p>
        <p>''It's a pity that our government hasn't taken any action to stop this,'' she said in an interview. While theft of personal property is a crime, the police have stood by, she said, as thieves have grabbed cats and sold them for about $3 to wholesale markets. There, they are sold to restaurants that often keep the cats and other live animals in cages for inspection by diners.</p>
        <p>Beijing has some stray cats, but house animals present an easier mark. The thieves, who often operate at night, are said to use fish and birds to lure wandering cats into their bags. Ms. Lu said that some fearful cat owners have begun to tether their cats at night to keep them from prowling the newly perilous alleys.</p>
        <p>Eating cat meat is of dubious benefit, said Lin Degui, a veterinary professor at the Beijing Agriculture University. Sometimes cats carry parasites dangerous to humans, he told The Beijing Morning Post, and in Guangdong, several people have been severely sickened by eating the meat of cats that had consumed rat poison in the streets.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lu described one case in which six cats in one northwestern section of Beijing were stolen the same day, as they lay on their owners' roofs sunning. The owners searched nearby restaurants and found the animals in cages. But the police refused to help, saying there was no specific law on the theft of pets.</p>
        <p>The owners later called Ms. Lu's group, she said, and members went to the restaurant -- only to find the cages already empty, and six families in tears.</p>
