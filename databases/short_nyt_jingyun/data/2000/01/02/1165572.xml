        <p>Barely six months ago, Brazil's government achieved a long-cherished objective with a carefully negotiated merger of all three of its military forces into a single ministry that is theoretically under civilian control.</p>
        <p>But now, to the government's embarrassment, the air force, the most nationalistic of the armed services, is noisily challenging that concept.</p>
        <p>The dispute has already led to the dismissal of the air force chief, Gen. Walter Brauer. It has also raised questions about the role of the military in politics and the economy at a time when President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is intent on reducing the size and reach of the state.</p>
        <p>Though Brazil was ruled by a military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, no one is suggesting that insubordination by the air force could lead to a coup attempt. The armed forces do not appear to have either the capacity or the desire for such an action.</p>
        <p>The crisis has been brewing at least since June, when Elcio Alvares, a former senator, was sworn in as the first civilian defense minister  and the army, navy and air force were forced to give up their separate cabinet-level posts. At that ceremony, General Brauer publicly snubbed Mr. Alvares and led a walkout of senior air force officers.</p>
        <p>The immediate cause of the general's dismissal, however, was his criticism of a close aide of Mr. Alvares whose name has surfaced in a congressional drug investigation. Contending that ''public life has to be very unblemished and transparent,'' General Brauer seemed to suggest in testimony before the congressional panel that the aide should be fired.</p>
        <p>That breach of hierarchy and protocol irritated Mr. Cardoso, and on Dec. 17 Mr. Alvares was ordered to get rid of both the aide and General Brauer. But political analysts note that larger issues lie behind the dismissal. David Fleischer, a professor at the University of Brasilia, said that the air force was ''the branch of the armed forces targeted for the greatest negative impact'' by the government's policy of selling off state-owned companies.</p>
        <p>The dominant nationalist wing of the air force has been particularly upset by the recent purchase of a 20 percent interest in the highly successful aircraft manufacturing company Embraer by a French consortium. The military regards the entry of foreign capital in a ''strategic sector'' as harmful to Brazil's national defense and commercial interests.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the Cardoso administration is discussing the privatization of Brazil's airports, despite objections by the air force, and plans to create a civil aviation agency that would strip the air force of the regulatory authority it currently exercises over airports and flights.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 28, scores of retired military officers and a handful of active duty generals and colonels attended a ''luncheon of grievance'' here honoring General Brauer. The leader of the retired officers' club, Gen. Ercio Braga, criticized the government for  ''disrespectful'' handling of the controversy. The event and comments immediately drew fire from Mr. Cardoso's supporters.</p>
        <p>''Military officers are able to make such declarations thanks to a democracy that they themselves did not help build.'' said Miro Teixeira, a prominent member of Congress.</p>
        <p>But an extreme right-wing member of Congress, Jair Bolsonaro, added fuel to the fire by saying of Mr. Cardoso, ''For the crime he is committing against the nation, his sentence should be death by firing squad.'' Fellow legislators were outraged and a vote to suspend him from office for a month is tentatively scheduled for next week.</p>
