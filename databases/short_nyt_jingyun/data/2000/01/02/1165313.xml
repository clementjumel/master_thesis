        <p>The knickers were a mistake. They called attention to Payne Stewart, just as he had intended, but in their clownishness they also camouflaged his seriousness of purpose and the purity and simplicity of his golf game. Stewart's swing wasn't the most powerful or the most accurate on the tour, but it was by far the prettiest -- the one weekend dubbers would most readily sign over their souls for.</p>
        <p>Stewart's life, though brief (he died at 42), was singularly American, proving that the fortunate among us are granted second, and even third, acts. There was a period of brash, early success, culminating in victories in the 1989 P.G.A. and the 1991 U.S. Open, and then an eight-year dark spell, during which he won only once. Later he said he had been using the wrong kind of clubs, but it was more than that -- he seemed to have lost his resolve.</p>

        <p>Stewart's life, though brief (he died at 42), was singularly American, proving that the fortunate among us are granted second, and even third, acts. There was a period of brash, early success, culminating in victories in the 1989 P.G.A. and the 1991 U.S. Open, and then an eight-year dark spell, during which he won only once. Later he said he had been using the wrong kind of clubs, but it was more than that -- he seemed to have lost his resolve.</p>
        <p>In 1998, having rededicated himself to golf, he led the U.S. Open by four shots at the start of the final round, but then, after a series of cruel reversals (including landing in a sand-filled divot -- a one-in-a-million chance), wound up losing by a stroke. In June, in the mists at Pinehurst No. 2, he finally captured the Open again, curling in a 15-footer on the final hole -- possibly the greatest pressure putt in golf history. On that final day he wore the knickers, of course, but also a practical piece of haberdashery: a sort of sleeveless poncho he had fashioned by hacking the sleeves off a windbreaker. He had been inspired, presumably, less by the ghosts of Bobby Jones et al. than by those resourceful types who know how to improvise rain gear from plastic trash bags.</p>
        <p>The eerie circumstances of Stewart's death in October -- the Lear jet, windows fogged over, flying past its destination and crashing into the Dakota wilds -- add a troubling and distracting coda to his achievements; and its untimeliness deprives him (and us) of the long and productive senior career at the end of which, the fitting heir apparent, he would have stepped into the voluminous plus fours of golf's other great clotheshorse, Gene Sarazen.</p>
        <p>Sarazen, who died last spring, at the age of 97, was an American story of another sort. The son of Italian immigrants (he was born Eugenio Saraceni), he studied the ways of the rich -- golf especially -- and became so successful that he was dubbed the Squire. After a knockabout apprenticeship in caddie shacks and pro shops all over the East, he burst onto the golf scene in 1922, winning both the U.S. Open and the P.G.A. when he was just 20. He was the Tiger Woods of his time -- which is to say, Tiger Woods without all the handlers. Sarazen was headstrong and impulsive, and he brought a new excitement -- and a new audience -- to golf.</p>
        <p>Like Stewart, he endured several seasons in the doldrums: he won the P.G.A. again in 1923, but then played almost a decade before winning the 1932 British and U.S. Opens. He went on to win the '33 P.G.A. and, most memorably, the 1935 Masters (when he holed out the legendary double eagle on the 15th). But in a way, Sarazen's greatest accomplishments were reserved for his lengthy old age, during which he became golf's endearing elder statesman. In 1963, at age 61, he made the cut at Augusta (the second-oldest person ever to do so), and 10 years later he not only broke 80 at the British Open at Troon but aced the eighth hole. He was a reminder that mellowness is sometimes sweeter even than early ripeness.</p>
