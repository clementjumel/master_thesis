        <p>A 47-year-old woman shot and killed her two adult children and her husband in the family's Mahopac, N.Y., home last week before killing herself, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The woman, JoAnn Gelsomino, 47, left a suicide note that told of the killings, but there was no clear motive, detectives from the Town of Carmel police said.</p>
        <p>The police went to the home yesterday after a co-worker called to say that Mrs. Gelsomino's daughter, Amanda, 22, had not shown up for work on Thursday or Friday, officials said.</p>
        <p>Investigators believe that sometime after 2 a.m. Thursday morning,  Mrs. Gelsomino left a car running in the garage in an attempt to poison her family, officials said. They said that she stepped outside after opening a door from the garage so that the car's carbon monoxide fumes would enter the house.</p>
        <p>Investigators said a coroner's report showed that the three victims were knocked out by the fumes. Mrs. Gelsomino then shot her husband, Robert, 59; her son, Anthony, 22, and Amanda before turning the gun on herself, officials said.</p>
