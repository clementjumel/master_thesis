        <p>Sara Ivry talked with Teresa Weatherspoon of the New York Liberty about Perrot, who died of cancer shortly before her team, the Houston Comets, won its third consecutive W.N.B.A. title.</p>
        <p>''My nephew passed away in May, and the Liberty happened to be playing in Houston. I really didn't want to be playing, my heart was so heavy. After that game, the person waiting for me, before I even got to the locker room, was Kim. She wasn't playing anymore, and I know she was feeling so bad, but she said: 'Spoon, if I can come back, the only reason I will is to play against you. Every time I watch you play, that makes me want to come back. But today, you didn't even play. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family. Do it for your brother, and please, do it for me.'''</p>
