        <p>Basketball players added muscles and multimillion-dollar sneaker contracts. American yachts lost the America's Cup, gained it back, then lost it again. Grass all but disappeared on tennis courts. The natural stuff almost became extinct in baseball and football before injuries and nostalgia spurred its comeback. Lights finally shone at Wrigley Field.

        <p>Basketball players added muscles and multimillion-dollar sneaker contracts. American yachts lost the America's Cup, gained it back, then lost it again. Grass all but disappeared on tennis courts. The natural stuff almost became extinct in baseball and football before injuries and nostalgia spurred its comeback. Lights finally shone at Wrigley Field.

        <p>The next 100 years hold intriguing possibilities for golf. The sport continues to grow in popularity, and Tiger Woods has become perhaps the world's most famous active athlete. Woods's career will be a key for golf in the early 21st century, because if he remains dominant for the next 10 to 15 years, his star power will only attract more fans and more corporate dollars.</p>
        <p>Expect golf's global appeal to broaden, with men and women from all parts of the world winning major championships. And there will be more youngsters like Woods, Sergio Garcia, and Se Ri Pak ready to win as professionals before they turn 21.</p>
        <p>But much of golf's future will depend on how well it capitalizes on its current strength. For golf to continue to grow, it must become more affordable and more accessible, giving more youngsters from diverse backgrounds a chance to play regularly and to become part of the game's future.</p>
