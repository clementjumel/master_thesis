        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Dec. 29 letter writer is correct to say the military is not a jobs program in responding to my comment that the armed forces are not a social experiment. The issue is not what is socially right but military effectiveness. The armed forces exist to protect this country's security. To do anything that would jeopardize this responsibility would be irresponsible and dangerous.</p>

        <p>A Dec. 29 letter writer is correct to say the military is not a jobs program in responding to my comment that the armed forces are not a social experiment. The issue is not what is socially right but military effectiveness. The armed forces exist to protect this country's security. To do anything that would jeopardize this responsibility would be irresponsible and dangerous.</p>
        <p>Many of my Republican colleagues and I have been critical of Congressional financing for unnecessary military projects. And we have publicly supported additional rounds of base closings in the next administration. Our national security budget must not be used as an economic engine.</p>
        <p>Whether determining a personnel policy, appropriating money for defense projects or authorizing a new round of base closings, national security must be the only consideration in determining military policy.</p>
        <p>CHUCK HAGEL  U.S. Senator from Nebraska  Washington, Dec. 29, 1999</p>
