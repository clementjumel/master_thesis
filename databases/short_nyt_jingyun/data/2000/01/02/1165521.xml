        <p>Raymond Satiro, 19, of New Rochelle, who pleaded guilty to hacking into America Online's internal computers, was sentenced Dec. 21 in Westchester County Court in White Plains to a year in prison and five years without a home computer.</p>
        <p>David Hebert, a spokesman for the county's district attorney's office, said Mr. Satiro, known to his friends as Jay, used his knowledge of America Online and information from other hackers to break into the service's internal computer system and alter data and programs by installing programs of his own. The damage was extensive, requiring expensive repairs, Mr. Hebert said.</p>

        <p>Raymond Satiro, 19, of New Rochelle, who pleaded guilty to hacking into America Online's internal computers, was sentenced Dec. 21 in Westchester County Court in White Plains to a year in prison and five years without a home computer.</p>

The damage was extensive, requiring expensive repairs, Mr. Hebert said.</p>
        <p>In October, Mr. Satiro pleaded guilty to first-degree computer tampering, a felony, and had faced a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. The sentence imposed by Acting Judge John M. Perone of County Court included prison time because Mr. Satiro violated the terms of his probation on an earlier youthful offender charge.</p>
        <p>The youthful offender conviction in October 1998 was for grand larceny, but the exact nature of the offense was withheld because of Mr. Satiro's age at that time.</p>
