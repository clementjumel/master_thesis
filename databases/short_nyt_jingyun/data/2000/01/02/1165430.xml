        <p>Opening a bar in SoHo with no sign is one thing. But not even giving it a name takes the whole anonymous-cool approach to a whole new level, and that was Scott Sartiano's strategy for his new lounge on the northwest corner of Spring and Sullivan Streets.</p>
        <p>''My preference was to let people find out about it via word of mouth, but in a slower, organic way, almost underground,'' he said. ''Having sort of an anonymous location, it takes longer to develop a following because people who've been here can't just tell their friends the name, or else they forget the address and simply can't find it again later.'' So far, Ethan Hawke, Peter Berg, Ivanka Trump, Matt Dillon and Chuck Knoblauch seem to have found their way there in the two months it has been open.</p>

        <p>So when people do make plans to meet at the nameless bar, what do they say? ''I've heard some people call it Scott's Place,'' Mr. Sartiano said, ''or maybe just the Lounge.'' But credit card receipts give it away: Spring Street Social Club. Just don't ask for it by name.</p>
