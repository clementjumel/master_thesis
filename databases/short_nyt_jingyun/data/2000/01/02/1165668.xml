        <p>Basketball players added muscles and multimillion-dollar sneaker contracts. American yachts lost the America's Cup, gained it back, then lost it again. Grass all but disappeared on tennis courts. The natural stuff almost became extinct in baseball and football before injuries and nostalgia spurred its comeback. Lights finally shone at Wrigley Field. Europe became a major talent pool for the National Hockey League; golf and tennis benefited from America's diversity. What could happen next, on and off the field? A look at nine sports.</p>
        <p>The future of soccer is hard to miss. It comes pouring out of the networks and the cable channels, via the dish, over the Internet.</p>
        <p>The world's game is already in vogue for millions of Americans, hyphenated or otherwise. Not relying on newspapers still stuck in ancient formulae, soccer fans seek out the world's male superstars where they are vastly available. Fans flick on the tube and marvel at David Beckham's silky passes for Manchester United. Fans crank up the Internet and follow the inexplicable burial of Roberto Baggio at Inter Milan. Fans push a button and there is Rivaldo of Brazil.</p>
        <p>The images on the screen put the domestic Major League Soccer in refreshing perspective. It is all right to be secondary. The best American lads must go overseas for the money and the challenge. They will come back for international tournaments and show what they have learned. In the meantime, Americans have a new love of soccer -- Michelle Akers's passion; Gao Hong's flair;  Sissi's romps; Linda Medalen's leadership.</p>
