        <p>Sea Jets, a new company based in Riviera Beach, Fla., has started hydrofoil service between Palm Beach, Fla., and Grand Bahama Island. Sea Jets' hydrofoils, called jetfoils and made by Boeing, can skim the surface of the water at more than 50 miles an hour and hold 250 passengers.</p>
        <p>The boats are entirely enclosed, with seating areas much like an aircraft's. Like air travelers, passengers are served soft drinks and snacks by cabin attendants. Beer, wine and liquor are available at extra cost.</p>
