        <p>The Millennium Girl</p>
        <p>By Coerte V. W. Felske.</p>
        <p>St. Martin's, $24.95.</p>
        <p>Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the bookstore, along comes another novel about How to Catch a Man at the Century's End. This one happens to be written by a man, the novelist-journalist-screenwriter Coerte V. W. Felske, but even that doesn't give it enough panache to stand out from the recent deluge of girl-guides. It's a face-to-face encounter with ''diggers,'' women who troll resort towns in search of the perfect millionaire. That ''The Millennium Girl'' is based on Felske's own reporting is perhaps its most interesting feature. We all know women like this exist, but until now we didn't have all the gory details. Our heroine is a nubile 28-year-old named Bodicea, who dyes her hair incessantly and has a wicked habit of giving her fellow diggers nicknames like ''Operation: I Do'' and ''Ellen B. Generous.'' We go on tour with the charming Bo as she uses men and vice versa, and along the way she dispenses various nuggets of self-analysis like ''if women weren't so jealous of one another, we'd be the rulers of the planet.'' Though the book has some hilarious and sympathetic moments, and even stops to examine a gay man's search for the perfect mate in the midst of all its trumped-up heterosexual sex scenes, it gets a little tiresome waiting for Bo to gain her humanity (which she eventually does, of course). But she has a real soul, pop psychology notwithstanding, which is perhaps the surest indicator that this is fiction.</p>
