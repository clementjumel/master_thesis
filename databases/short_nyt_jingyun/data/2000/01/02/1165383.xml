        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree with Justice Emily Jane Goodman's complaint that television gives a distorted view of female judges by portraying them as seductresses and bimbos [''Seducers, Harassers and Wimps in Black Robes'' Dec. 19].

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree with Justice Emily Jane Goodman's complaint that television gives a distorted view of female judges by portraying them as seductresses and bimbos [''Seducers, Harassers and Wimps in Black Robes'' Dec. 19]. This they are not. What she fails to mention, however, is that reality is just as unflattering.</p>
        <p>In my 20 years of appearing before the courts of the State of New York, it has become painfully apparent that a large percentage of judges, both male and female, are intellectually or temperamentally unsuited for their jobs. ''Judge Judy'' and her equally moronic husband did not suddenly acquire their obnoxious personalities after they left the bench. They, and too many others of their ilk, honed them over the years of their unfortunate tenure and now present an unflatteringly accurate representation of similar dullards and boors who litter our justice system. One need only read the depressing reports of the Commission on Judicial Conduct to get a flavor of what is all too common.</p>
        <p>As long as we continue to allow our judiciary to be a dumping ground for political hacks, where party loyalty frequently counts more than ability in gaining nomination, we will continue to get the debased product we now endure.</p>
