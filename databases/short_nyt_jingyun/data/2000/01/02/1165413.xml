        <p>ALONG the Delaware River north of Trenton, on a stretch where George Washington led his Continental Army across during the Revolutionary War, workers are adding a little modern technology to another historic presence there, a barge canal built in the 1830's.</p>
        <p>The project will add automatically controlled spillways to the old Delaware and Raritan Canal, which was built to carry coal and other cargo between eastern New Jersey and the Delaware. In 1930 the state converted the canals to a system that is now used to transport water from the Delaware River to Somerset, Mercer and Middlesex Counties. The canal, the old towpath and the right-of-way are part of state park system.</p>

        <p>ALONG the Delaware River north of Trenton, on a stretch where George Washington led his Continental Army across during the Revolutionary War, workers are adding a little modern technology to another historic presence there, a barge canal built in the 1830's.</p>

The canal, the old towpath and the right-of-way are part of state park system.</p>
        <p>The work, which included the building of steel-reinforced concrete retaining walls, began last summer and should be completed sometime in the spring. As the work is done, original stonework and construction must be preserved to maintain the historic integrity of the canal. Some stones, first laid more than 160 years ago, were numbered and catalogued before they were removed so they can be replaced in the exact position when the project is complete.</p>
