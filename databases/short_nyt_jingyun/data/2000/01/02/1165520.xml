        <p>The 100th annual Christmas Bird Count -- the 76th for the Bronx-Westchester area -- counted 120 species and 56,324 birds, reported Michael Bochnik, the compiler for local Audubon group.</p>
        <p>It also showed that the crow count dropped sharply from last year, in part, Mr. Bochnik speculated, because many had been killed during this summer's outbreak of West Nile-like virus.</p>
        <p>The count was down this year to 1,349 from 3,547 last year.</p>
        <p>The Christmas Day count drew about 70 bird counters on a morning when the temperature dipped to 23 degrees and the wind chill factor rose.</p>
        <p>''One group started owling at 5 a.m.,'' Mr. Bochnik reported. ''The rest started at daybreak, about 7 a.m.''</p>
        <p>A new bird -- the West Coast version of the dark-eyed junco, called a pink-sided junco, was found in Riverdale Park in the Bronx, probably a stray that had ''flown east instead of south,'' Mr. Bochnik said.</p>
        <p>A Baltimore oriole, which would usually be in the South by now, was also spotted, as were two peregrine falcons, an endangered species, at Edith Read Sanctuary in Rye.</p>
        <p>More ducks and geese were counted this year than in the past, most likely because the weather remained warmer for a longer period this fall and the waters stayed open, Mr. Bochnik said.</p>
