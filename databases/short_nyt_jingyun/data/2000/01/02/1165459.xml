        <p>No one seems to know when the last Medal of Valor was awarded in New Jersey, but now one has been presented to  Sgt. Joseph Manto of the National Guard for the rescue of two Lodi police officers who were trapped by floodwaters during Tropical Storm Floyd. The Medal of Valor is the highest honor a National Guard member can receive for civilian action.</p>
        <p>When the Saddle River flooded Sept. 16, Sergeant. Manto's unit was dispatched to Lodi, where the police and firefighters were evacuating residents by boat. During one rescue effort, two Lodi officers were trapped on a boat that capsized and was pinned against a fence post by the strong current in the 12-foot deep floodwaters, Sergeant Manto said.</p>

        <p>When the Saddle River flooded Sept. 16, Sergeant. Manto's unit was dispatched to Lodi, where the police and firefighters were evacuating residents by boat. During one rescue effort, two Lodi officers were trapped on a boat that capsized and was pinned against a fence post by the strong current in the 12-foot deep floodwaters, Sergeant Manto said.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Manto, accompanied by a local contractor and a Lodi police officer, scaled a building and ran across rooftops to get nearer the two officers and then  used a 40-foot ladder and rope belonging to the contractor to pull the two to safety.</p>
        <p>''I don't even want to think about what might have happened if we had not gotten there,'' Sergeant Manto said last week. ''The current was so strong it moved one of our military trucks four blocks.''</p>
        <p>Sergeant Manto, who will retire from the Guard with 20 years service next March, was presented with the Medal of Valor by Governor Whitman. Staff Sgt. Mark Olsen, spokesman for the New Jersey National Guard, said he could not find a record of any other Medal of Valor ever being awarded in the state.</p>
