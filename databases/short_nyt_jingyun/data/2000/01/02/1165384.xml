        <p>The 80-year-old Kaufman Astoria Studios in the Astoria section of Queens is about to add a new building at its sprawling, 12-acre site, giving the studios a seventh sound stage. The studios are a national historic landmark, and celebrated performers from Rudolph Valentino to Placido Domingo have worked on its stages and in its studios.</p>
        <p>The 40,000-square-foot building is to rise across the street from Kaufman's main entrance at 34-12 36th Street, on a 30,000-square-foot site partially occupied by vacant buildings at present. It is an $8.425 million development project, with demolition of existing buildings scheduled to start next month, a groundbreaking due in April and completion scheduled for the end of next year.</p>
        <p>The two-tiered building is to contain up to 25,000 square feet of space for all stages of production work, from set design to editing. Plans call for a sound stage of up to 18,000 square feet and room to accommodate an audience of up to 350 people.</p>
        <p>The latest in technology will enable the stage to handle film, television and advertising productions, said Dennis C. Janson, managing partner of the Janson Design Group of Manhattan, which is the building's architect and interior designer.</p>
        <p>Started in 1920 by Famous Players/Lasky (later known as Paramount Studios), Astoria Studios was bought by the federal government in 1942 and used until 1970 for Army training and propaganda films. The complex was renamed Kaufman Astoria Studios in 1982, when New York City took title and leased the property to a partnership that included George S. Kaufman, Alan King and Johnny Carson.</p>
        <p>Kaufman Astoria leases three of its six stages to Lifetime Studios. Of the three that Kaufman operates, one is occupied by CBS's ''Cosby.'' The Children's Television Workshop's ''Sesame Street'' is a long-term tenant of the second, and a new ABC show, ''Talk to Me,'' occupies the third.</p>
        <p>''We've been thinking about expanding for a while,'' said Hal G. Rosenbluth, president of Kaufman. Putting the financing together for an $8.425 million building that offers a service rather than a product was not easy, Mr. Rosenbluth added. What makes it work is the partnership with the state, the city and the City Council in the enterprise, he said.</p>
        <p>The City Council is providing a $2.5 million grant and $600,000 for demolition costs. A $125,000 grant from the office of Borough President Claire Shulman has been pledged. The city and the state are providing loans totaling $2.9 million, and Astoria Federal Savings has agreed to a $2.3 million loan. Kaufman is contributing property valued at $2 million. The new building will be owned by the city, which is to give Kaufman a 99-year lease.</p>
