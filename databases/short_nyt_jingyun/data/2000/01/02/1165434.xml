        <p>The Perlman Music Program, a school for gifted young musicians, has found a new home, but it won't be in Sagaponack. Instead, the program plans to move to Shelter Island, where it is under contract to buy the Peconic Lodge, a waterfront hotel, for $3 million.

        <p>The lodge, set on about 30 acres,  contains 3 main buildings, a dining hall and 21 cabins and will require minimum work to make it usable as a school as well as a hotel, said the Perlman lawyer, Patricia Blake of Melville.</p>
        <p>Last summer vociferous opposition from some neighbors greeted the news that the Perlman Music Program, directed by Toby Perlman and her husband, Itzhak, the violinist, was planning to build a campus on 20 acres of farmland in Sagaponack, not far from the Perlmans' home in East Hamptonents.</p>
        <p>''After the story appeared we were contacted by people all over the area offering us property,'' said Suki Sadler, a co-founder and president of the program, which brings young string players from all over the world to the East End for four weeks of study.</p>
