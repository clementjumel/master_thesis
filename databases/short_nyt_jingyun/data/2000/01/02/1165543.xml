        <p>In suddenly resigning as Russian president on Friday, Boris Yeltsin showed once again why he will be remembered as a practitioner of the unexpected political stratagem. Like so many of Mr. Yeltsin's gambits over the years, the move upended expectations and scrambled Russian politics. It also came with a promise of immunity from prosecution for Mr. Yeltsin for any misdeeds of his government.

        <p>Mr. Yeltsin's action immediately lifted the presidential prospects of the politician he hopes will succeed him, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Under the Russian Constitution, Mr. Putin became acting president when Mr. Yeltsin stepped aside, and the date for new elections was advanced from June to March.

        <p>In suddenly resigning as Russian president on Friday, Boris Yeltsin showed once again why he will be remembered as a practitioner of the unexpected political stratagem. Like so many of Mr. Yeltsin's gambits over the years, the move upended expectations and scrambled Russian politics. It also came with a promise of immunity from prosecution for Mr. Yeltsin for any misdeeds of his government.  That will likely roil the coming presidential campaign, a fitting legacy for a courageous but disappointingly erratic man who guided Russia through the first years of a turbulent, still unfinished journey from tyranny to democracy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin's action immediately lifted the presidential prospects of the politician he hopes will succeed him, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Under the Russian Constitution, Mr. Putin became acting president when Mr. Yeltsin stepped aside, and the date for new elections was advanced from June to March. That gives Mr. Putin the powerful advantage of campaigning as an incumbent at a time when his popularity is surging because of the Russian military offensive in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin, for one last time, seemed to be betting that an impulsive, bold move would turn Russia toward a more promising future. As with earlier Yeltsin surprises, a positive outcome is far from assured. For one thing, the political terrain could shift abruptly even by March if Russians became disillusioned with the attack on Chechnya.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's political instincts also remain unclear. He is a former K.G.B. officer and head of Russia's domestic intelligence agency. As prime minister, he has prosecuted a brutal assault on Chechnya. Yet he has encouraged economic reform, has talked of the need to improve relations with the West and is allied with some of Russia's most progressive politicians.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Yeltsin's uneven leadership, Russia could use a steady, reform-minded president who knows how to run an efficient government. Mr. Yeltsin was the first freely elected leader of Russia. His great strengths were an iron will and a daring vision for remaking Russia into a free-market democracy. He was fearless in his drive to rid Russia of Communism, and his stand against an attempted coup in 1991 kept reform alive. Later that year he engineered the end of Communist rule in Moscow and the collapse of the Soviet empire. History will honor him for these acts.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Yeltsin proved indifferent at governing. Economic reform was stunted by corruption, his government failed to collect taxes, and his penchant for sacking prime ministers often left the Kremlin in disarray. Opposition in the parliament made governing difficult, but Mr. Yeltsin lacked the discipline to manage a complex government.</p>
        <p>Though he broadly pursued closer ties with the West, and played a helpful role in ending the war in Kosovo last year, Mr. Yeltsin could be inconsistent in dealing with foreign issues. His preoccupation with Chechnya wounded Russia at home and abroad. Weakened by heart problems and respiratory ailments, he was in recent years a shell of the leader he had been in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Many Russians will doubtless question the sincerity of the apology Mr. Yeltsin offered on Friday for the mistakes he made and the economic hardships that so many of his countrymen have endured.  More information will be needed before anyone can judge whether the decision to spare Mr. Yeltsin from possible prosecution was warranted or wise.  However, Russians ought not to forget the singular achievement of Boris Yeltsin. For all his maddening weaknesses, he led his nation toward democracy after 1,000 years of tyranny.</p>
