        <p>On most days, 11-year-old Azamat Malikov spends at least an hour or two doing what comes naturally to many people in Kyrgyzstan. He works at memorizing what is said to be the world's longest epic poem.</p>
        <p>One sunny afternoon, Azamat, resplendent in a dark blue velvet robe,  chanted the story of a battle so vividly that he even frightened a visitor who could speak no Kyrgyz. Azamat rocked to and fro, waved his arms and changed his expressions wildly to illustrate the text.</p>
        <p>''My grandfather asked me to please learn the Manas epic,'' Azamat said afterward. ''He told me that if I did, I would become a very good person.''</p>
        <p>Scholars who have studied this epic call it as stirring as ''The Iliad,'' as episodic as ''Don Quixote'' and as rich in moral guidance as the Gospels. It tells the story of an ancient hero who fought to establish and defend a homeland for the Kyrgyz people. His resolute commitment to virtue makes the epic a textbook of moral values as well as an enthralling story.</p>
        <p>It is also the main cultural treasure of the Kyrgyz people, and has played a central role in their history. Lacking a strong religious or political tradition, the Kyrgyz use the legend of Manas to define their collective identity.</p>
        <p>It is what binds them together as a people and, some believe, what has allowed them to survive while other Asian peoples have vanished into history.</p>
        <p>Although the Manas epic is many centuries old, it was first written down in fragments less than 150 years ago. It is a quintessentially oral work, passed down across many generations by Manaschis, masters of recitation who chant it at festivals and other gatherings. Most of these Manaschis have been men and women with strong constitutions -- able to go on for hours or days at a time and often slipping into a kind of trance as they chant.</p>
        <p>Because there has never been an authoritative text, each Manaschi can weave in original lines, and even episodes and characters. The greatest of them are revered as prodigious creators in their own right. Over the centuries, they have forged a culture of memorization that is as strong as any in the world.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because the Manas tradition is oral rather than written, it has proved impossible to suppress. Czarist conquerors and later the Soviet authorities sought to manipulate its message of Kyrgyz self-determination. But the tradition is thriving today, thanks in part to support from the Kyrgyz authorities.</p>
        <p>Since Kyrgyzstan emerged from the debris of the Soviet Union in 1991, its educational system has been in ruins. The authorities have decided to concentrate on an elite of talented children and have opened up several schools for them. Most of them -- like the Meerim School in Osh, the second largest city in Kyrgyzstan -- offer courses on the Manas legend.</p>
        <p>Meerim's pupils are selected from among the gifted and ambitious. Most come from poor families. Once accepted, some choose to learn ceramics, computer technology or other skills. But the group that concentrates on Manas has a special cachet.</p>
        <p>''For us Manas is not just about history,'' said the school's director, Sayrakan Usupova. ''It teaches the importance of being good. Naturally these kids are excited to be the center of attention when they perform at weddings and parties. They take their competitions very seriously.''</p>
        <p>''But this is not really about show,'' Ms. Usupova said. ''It's about teaching moral principles for the present day. No child who studies Manas will ever grow up to be dishonest or negative or unproductive.''</p>
        <p>The eponymous hero of this epic is described as a towering figure who could uproot any tree and hurl boulders from the heights of the Tian Shan mountain range. He vowed at age 12 to free his people from oppression, and lived a noble life until he was treacherously killed. His burial place is secret, and when anyone seeking it comes too close, a storm is said to break out that can only be calmed by reciting the epic.</p>
        <p>No one knows when this story was first told. Kyrgyz clans moved into the territory they now inhabit following epic battles in the ninth century, and feats performed then may have been the basis for some episodes. The 300 years that followed proved to be a rich period for Kyrgyz life and culture. Not only the Manas poem but also more than a dozen other epics, some of them still performed today, emerged during this period.</p>
        <p>The figure of Manas is not known to be based on any single individual.</p>
        <p>By one count, his life story has been told in more than 60 versions.</p>
        <p>Parts of the original text have undoubtedly been lost forever, but scholars say more than half a million lines survive. That would make this epic more than 30 times as long as ''The Odyssey.''</p>
        <p>No definitive version of the surviving epic exists, but the government is collecting material and hopes to publish one in the next few years, first in Kyrgyz, then in Russian and perhaps in English. But resources here are limited, and even with the help of the United Nations there has been little progress on plans to release recordings of Manaschis in performance.</p>
        <p>President Askar Akayev, who likes to give visitors a two-volume English translation of selections from the epic, said in an interview that he first heard it chanted in his native village when he was 4 or 5. He added with evident pride that he had personally heard the late Sayakbai Karalayev, said to have been one of this century's greatest Manaschis.</p>
        <p>''For the Kyrgyz people, Manas is more than an epic,'' Mr. Akayev said. ''It's what the Bible is to Christians. It inspired people in their hard times.</p>
        <p>''Thanks to Manas, this small nation preserved its traditions and history, and survived to become a country in Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan can become successful in the 21st century only by adopting modern technology while at the same time preserving the moral code from Manas.''</p>
        <p>In 1995 Mr. Akayev convened regional leaders and other dignitaries for a lavish celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of the Manas epic. The date was purely symbolic, and the expense left a bad taste in a country where most people's living standards have plummeted since the fall of Communism.</p>
        <p>During his speech at the celebration, Mr. Akayev said that everyone in Kyrgyzstan should adhere to the seven basic principles of Manas. This raised some eyebrows, since no one had ever heard of such principles. It later turned out that the president himself had divined them.</p>
        <p>He listed them as national unity; a generous and tolerant humanism; friendship and cooperation among nations; harmony with nature; patriotism; hard work and education; and ''strengthening and defense of the Kyrgyz state system.''</p>
        <p>These principles are now being taught in Kyrgyz schools. They have become a kind of official study guide for the epic, reminding young people of the lessons they should learn from it. In effect Mr. Akayev has made this epic the main source of spiritual guidance for his reborn nation.</p>
        <p>''People should have beliefs to shape their lives around,'' said Beksultan Jakiev, a poet and playwright who runs the government agency devoted to supporting the Manas epic. ''Given our traditions, it's logical that this should be where people's ethical base begins.''</p>
        <p>At least two active Manaschis, both in their 70's, are acknowledged as current masters. More are likely to emerge in future generations.</p>
        <p>But some people fear that by turning the epic into a kind of ideology, Mr. Akayev risks cheapening it.</p>
        <p>''The president has chosen Manas as the state ideal of Kyrgyzstan,'' said Alexander Kim, a newspaper editor in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital. ''He can't use Islamic or Christian or Marxist principles, so he artificially created these seven Manas principles.</p>
        <p>''This is a work of huge cultural and historical importance, but when it's pressed onto people, that naturally produces resistance. I personally like to read and study Manas, but I resist when I feel that I'm being forced to do it.''</p>
        <p>A larger-than-life equestrian statue of Manas, flanked by his parents, dominates one of the central plazas in Bishkek. On the four corners of the plaza are busts of great Manaschis of the past.</p>
        <p>Young people who pass by seem interested in the epic and even proud of it.</p>
        <p>One of them, Jyldyz Mambetova, 23, said she considered early Manaschis to have been ''the first rappers.'' She first heard the epic from her grandmother and now reads sections of it whenever she can.</p>
        <p>''I never knew the Kyrgyz language could be so rich and expressive,'' Ms. Mambetova said. ''There are so many words I didn't know. And the stories aren't just exciting. Each one of them has a moral point. Not many people realize what great cultural wealth this is.''</p>
