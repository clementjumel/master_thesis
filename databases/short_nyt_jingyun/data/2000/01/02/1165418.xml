        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>As I searched for a parking space at the Bernardsville ShopRite on Christmas Eve morning, I noticed that just exiting a space marked ''Expectant mothers only'' was a car with a man driving. Shaking my head, I watched as a car pulled into the space. It was occupied by two nuns. The miracle of  Christmas.</p>
        <p>TOM IORRIZZO</p>
        <p>We recently put a deposit on a cemetery plot, and now it was time to make the final payment. I called to ask if the cemetery would accept Mastercard, and the woman on the other end of the line said, ''Certainly, what is your card number?''</p>
        <p>I read all the digits of my account.</p>
        <p>''What is the expiration date?'' she then asked.</p>
        <p>I asked whether she wanted the expiration date of my card, or me.</p>
        <p>She broke up with laughter.</p>
        <p>GORDON D. RAPP</p>
        <p>The holiday crowd in a Princeton supermarket was augmented by more than the usual folk the other day. And I wasn't the only person who was startled to see a sparrow fly down an aisle and land on a parked shopping cart.</p>
        <p>As she grabbed cans of cat food off the shelf, a fellow shopper remarked: ''I guess this really is the pet aisle.''</p>
        <p>LINDA OPPENHEIM</p>
        <p>When I called my son Steve recently, my 4-year-old granddaughter, Lacey, answered the phone.</p>
        <p>When I asked her to call Steve, I heard her say in the background, ''Daddy, the phone's for you.''</p>
        <p>While waiting, I thought I would see if she understood our family relationship.</p>
        <p>''Lacey, what is Steve to you?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>She replied, ''Daddy.''</p>
        <p>Then I asked, ''What am I to you?''</p>
        <p>''Grandma,'' was her reply.</p>
        <p>And finally I asked, ''What is Steve to me?''</p>
        <p>Without hesitation, she answered. ''Good.''</p>
        <p>FRED NUSSBAUM</p>
        <p>(And speaking of children and telephones.)</p>
        <p>I call a friend in New York the other day, and the conversation with her daughter went like this:</p>
        <p>Me: ''Hi, May I speak with your mom?''</p>
        <p>Child: ''. . . Um. O.K.''</p>
        <p>(silence)</p>
        <p>Me: ''Is she at home, sweetheart?''</p>
        <p>Child: ''Y-y-y-e-s.''</p>
        <p>Me: ''Can I talk to her please?''</p>
        <p>Child: Can you hold on for 10 minutes?''</p>
        <p>(silence)</p>
        <p>Child: '' . . .  and don't count, O.K.? . . . O.K?''</p>
        <p>(silence)</p>
        <p>I never did get to speak to my friend that day (sigh).</p>
        <p>RAJ MERCHANT</p>
        <p>FAREWELL, NOEL</p>
        <p>'Twas the day after Christmas and all through the mall</p>
        <p>Not a carol was heard that had blared throughout fall.</p>
        <p>The Salvation Army was furloughed, I guess,</p>
        <p>And reindeer had flown to another address,</p>
        <p>The tannenbaum felled and the mistletoe missing,</p>
        <p>With malcontent shoppers in no mood for kissing.</p>
        <p>The creche is in storage, the Virgin released, her</p>
        <p>Floor space relinquished to fashions for Easter.</p>
        <p>For as 'twas with Christmas, without rhyme or reason,</p>
        <p>The stores rush another liturgical season.</p>
        <p>While, sheeplike, the People of God (every one!)</p>
        <p>Queue up at ''Exchanges,'' Redemption's begun.</p>
