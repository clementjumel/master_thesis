Since 1995 when the law took effect, more than $4.8 billion in support payments have been collected.</p>
        <p>More than 300,000 people have made a payment since being notified of impending suspension of their licenses. Additionally, a program with the state's Office of Taxation and Finance to make collections has resulted in receipts that averaged just under $1 million a week last year.</p>
        <p>Collections have increased by an average of 10.6 percent each year since 1994, while the number of people paying child support increased by an average of 7.6 percent a year.</p>
