        <p>Barbara Aronowitz letter disagrees with Bill Desowitz's Dec 12 (1999) article on film characterizations (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the article ''Finding Spiritual Rebirth in a Valley of Male Ennui'' [Dec. 12], Bill Desowitz compared Kevin Spacey's character in ''American Beauty'' to Emily from Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town.'' I can grasp the similarity of themes between the two works, but I disagree with Mr. Desowitz's analysis. Emily appreciated life while she lived it; she was bewildered by her life after death. She excelled in school, fell in love and was proud of the work she and her husband had done on the farm.</p>

        <p>The character who experienced hopelessness in ''Our Town'' was Simon Stimson, who committed suicide. He had no appreciation for life before or after his death.</p>
