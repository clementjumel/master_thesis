        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffiths contends that for today's composers ''the biggest challenge'' is to ''find something that speaks from, for, and of them.'' That is a challenge every artist faces; our challenge is rather to find something that speaks to vast numbers of people. Classical music hardly does so now; indeed, the emergence of Thomas Ades is a media event partly because the classical-music machine can scarcely accommodate one Ades in a generation.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffiths contends that for today's composers ''the biggest challenge'' is to ''find something that speaks from, for, and of them.'' That is a challenge every artist faces; our challenge is rather to find something that speaks to vast numbers of people. Classical music hardly does so now; indeed, the emergence of Thomas Ades is a media event partly because the classical-music machine can scarcely accommodate one Ades in a generation.</p>
        <p>There are only two musical forms capable of reaching and captivating a mass audience: the popular song and the film score (with the Broadway musical constituting an amalgam of the two). Absolute or abstract music no longer seems to do the job in today's pluralistic musical landscape, in which new composers must compete with the products of a full millennium of the Western art tradition as well as with a bewildering array of popular and indigenous musics from around the world.</p>
        <p>I suggest that if there is a future for serious music, it lies in the domain of dramatic, storytelling music. Ballet is geriatric if not moribund as a vehicle for new music, but the musical theater (from which I except opera) appears to be alive and well, if not necessarily good. Jonathan Larson, the creator of ''Rent,'' might have been a continuing phenomenon if he had lived. There are certain to be others, drawn by the opportunity to engage a large and willing audience -- which, unlike the audience for opera, clamors not only for repeated performances and tours of new work but for recordings and films as well.</p>
