The images, sometimes beautiful and often startling, are hidden to the naked eye but captured by modern science. They range from the inner workings of the body to the outer reaches of the cosmos.</p>
        <p>''Beyond Appearances'' is a companion exhibition to ''Seeing Is Believing: 700 Years of Scientific and Medical Illustration,'' which is  on view at at the New York Public Library, and covers the period from the Middle Ages to the late 19th century. ''Beyond Appearances'' picks up chronologically from there and explores how 20th-century advances in technology have increased understanding of physics and biology.</p>
        <p>''Beyond Appearances,'' Friday through March 31; 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday; PaineWebber Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas (between 51st and 52nd Streets); free; (212) 713-2885.</p>
