        <p>WELL, we survived.</p>
        <p>If you remember back to the 1900's, it was touch and go. Or so it seemed. People feared something called Y2K. Terrorists abounded. Others thought time would expire with a bang.</p>
        <p>Then there was a silent majority secretly hoping for a kind of inverse Y2K, a time-as-panacea where rather than all life's conveniences going haywire, all of life's little annoyances, from telemarketers to catalog profusion, would mysteriously clear up. It would be, as the joke goes, like playing country and western music backward: You'd get out of jail. Your dog would come back to life. Your wife would return. Your pickup would run smoothly.</p>

        <p>WELL, we survived.</p>
        <p>If you remember back to the 1900's, it was touch and go. Or so it seemed. People feared something called Y2K. Terrorists abounded. Others thought time would expire with a bang.</p>
        <p>Then there was a silent majority secretly hoping for a kind of inverse Y2K, a time-as-panacea where rather than all life's conveniences going haywire, all of life's little annoyances, from telemarketers to catalog profusion, would mysteriously clear up. It would be, as the joke goes, like playing country and western music backward: You'd get out of jail. Your dog would come back to life. Your wife would return. Your pickup would run smoothly.</p>
        <p>We just can't seem to let the turning of the clock alone. Gerald Celente, the editor of Trends Journal in Rhinebeck, N.Y., said it was part of what he called the ''Narcissistic 90's'' where everything had to be a big statement, like ''big cars, big houses and big mouths.'' He said this last week while widely promoting his ''Top 10 Trends of the 21st Century,'' which included a new millennium religion, an Internet-based political revolution and other Big Ideas. Mr. Celente hurriedly excused himself, saying, ''I've got MSNBC, Fox, CNN, a lot of things.'' But he first imparted this cautionary note: ''By nature, the future is foreseeably unforeseeable.''</p>
        <p>Who could argue? Or even understand?</p>
        <p>Some perspective was found in a most unlikely place. At a day care center for the elderly in Mount Kisco called My Second Home, there were people like Hilda Hiller, 83, who have spent a lot of time watching time tick by.</p>
        <p>''We go year by year,'' Ms. Hiller said. ''Day by day. It sneaks up on you. You plan for one season and then the next and they roll into each other.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hiller, wearing a red sweatshirt that said ''Am I Cool or What?'' with a picture of a snowman in sunglasses, acknowledges it will be difficult to get her head around living in another century. ''I've been with one so long, it's hard to think about being in a different one,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Big deal, says Eleanor Sponheimer, who is 95 and less than overwhelmed by the big moment. ''It happens all the time,'' she said. ''Time is going. Time changes.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sponheimer, it should be pointed out, is not some naysayer. She has seized a few opportunities in her time, graduating from college at age 66, getting a master's degree in English at 72 and then teaching for a few years in Danbury, Conn.</p>
        <p>''Of course, I always look forward to things,'' Ms. Sponheimer said. ''I think that's human nature.''</p>
        <p>But it can be a struggle, especially now with the whole world seemingly bent on hurtling forward. At the elderly center, you can feel the tug between the hazy future and the memory of all that has gone before.</p>
        <p>Angela La Grassa embodies it.</p>
        <p>A spirited woman of 82, her eye-catching purple dress and matching shoes are a statement. At the center's Millennium Lunch on Thursday, her friends want her to sing a favorite song. But she isn't in the mood. Her husband died several months ago. She pulls a picture from her pocketbook of her wedding in 1937. They were a stunning couple, their faces pressed close together. She was a seamstress in the garment district, he was a tailor. And they danced. ''You heard of the Roseland?'' she asked. ''That was our second home.''</p>
        <p>She wants to be happy so she lets her friends talk her into making the moment special. She stands and she sings perfectly in Italian, her foot tapping and her eyes growing brighter. The song is by her father, who was a musician, and when she finishes, she sings it in English.</p>
        <p>''Darling, you are my first love, You are my love forever,'' she sings. ''You are mine forever, from now till eternity.''</p>
        <p>Ms. La Grassa sits down to applause and the celebration of the future continues.</p>
        <p>At one point they talk about what they would put in a time capsule. A Bible. An encyclopedia. A Hop Along Cassidy episode, someone says. A clock, another suggests.</p>
        <p>Why a clock?</p>
        <p>''To show that time goes on,'' said Rita Lehman.</p>
        <p>To which a weak voice somewhere in the room added: ''With or without us.''</p>
