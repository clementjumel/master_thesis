        <p>Michael Doneff opens Nice House, a home furnishing store, in Greenwich Village (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the Nice House holiday window display at 117 Perry Street (between Hudson and Greenwich Streets) stand three matching plastic soul dancer dolls. But Ricky Lee, an employee at the store, doesn't know how much they're selling for. He isn't even certain they're for sale. Mr. Lee explained, ''I think Michael likes them too much too sell them.''</p>
        <p>Michael Doneff personally picks each item he sells at Nice House, which he opened in October after 14 years in public relations and marketing in home furnishings and design. In a space shared with the Rural Connection, an upstate New York real estate agency and decorating business, Mr. Doneff's selection includes ceramic vases ($18), bamboo chopsticks ($6 for 10) and alabaster boxes ($55), as well as a few larger furnishings like a wood spindle floor lamp ($345) and a baker's cabinet ($600). Mr. Doneff said he had to open the store because: ''I love flea markets and antique shows. I couldn't keep buying because I couldn't fit any more in my apartment.''</p>
