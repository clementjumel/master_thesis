        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article ''Between Two Worlds'' (Dec. 12), featuring Muslim teenagers who are supposedly caught between the world of Islam and the Western world, is outrageous -- especially since it only targets the Muslims as being the one caught in such a dilemma!</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article ''Between Two Worlds'' (Dec. 12), featuring Muslim teenagers who are supposedly caught between the world of Islam and the Western world, is outrageous -- especially since it only targets the Muslims as being the one caught in such a dilemma!</p>
        <p>What about the other religions and races? They also revolve between two worlds, and I must say that this article was completely biased and  one-sided. On the negative side.</p>
        <p>People will now look at Muslim ladies adorned in hijab and say ''Well I guess they are repressed,'' which is not true! Muslims, especially women, are very independant and they can achieve any aspirations as long as they are within the bounds of the Islamic laws.</p>
        <p>It is a shame that Islam is portrayed by the media as an imprisonment whan in actuality it is a willing and honest submission to Allah, regardless of what people think, say or do!</p>
