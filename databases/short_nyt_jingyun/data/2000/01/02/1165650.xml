        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Sol Stern (Op-Ed, Dec. 29) criticizes Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew for opposing more ''entrepreneurial'' approaches to education. He argues that Dr. Crew should have supported school vouchers and should have tried to tie the salaries of teachers to ''their productivity or their effectiveness'' rather than to their seniority.</p>
        <p>But the many excellent school districts surrounding the city provide ample evidence to the contrary. These school systems don't need vouchers to create competitive pressures for school success, nor do they rely on merit pay to attract and retain a qualified teaching staff.</p>
        <p>Instead of looking to a market model, we should get to the hard work of reforming and eliminating the structures that prevent city schools from emulating the successful models in the metropolitan area.  DANIEL A. SIMON  New York, Dec. 29, 1999</p>
