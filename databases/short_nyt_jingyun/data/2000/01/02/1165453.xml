        <p>The year is just a couple of days old, so there's plenty of time to get your money's worth if you invest in a year 2000 calendar. That's particularly true if you choose a calendar that features artwork of teenagers from New Jersey. The New Jersey State Teen Arts calendar is the 31st put out by New Jersey State Teen Arts, which is dedicated to promoting arts education for students in public and private schools, mainly through mentorships (the organization just got a grant from Channel 11 to set up mentorships with video professionals). The calendars have gone to legislators and schools, but there are some left at no charge beyond $2.50 for shipping, from New Jersey Teen Arts, 1422 Route 179, Lambertville, N.J. 08530; (609) 397-0505. The group also publishes an anthology of writing by teenagers, puts on a touring art show (at the State Aquarium in Camden through this month) and holds an annual arts festival. This year's, at the College of New Jersey in Trenton, will be May 24 and 25. You can mark the dates.</p>
