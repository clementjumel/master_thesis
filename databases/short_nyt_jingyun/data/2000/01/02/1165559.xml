        <p>Some New Yorkers noticed recently that the State Department of Taxation and Finance had added a new feature to its Web site -- allowing taxpayers and accountants to check the state's tally of estimated tax payments against their own records, which often do not match. Accounts were available for 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>''It's a great service,'' said Jay Scheidlinger, an accountant with Israeloff, Trattner &amp; Company. ''We used it for a few clients and it worked out perfectly.''</p>

        <p>Some New Yorkers noticed recently that the State Department of Taxation and Finance had added a new feature to its Web site -- allowing taxpayers and accountants to check the state's tally of estimated tax payments against their own records, which often do not match. Accounts were available for 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>''It's a great service,'' said Jay Scheidlinger, an accountant with Israeloff, Trattner &amp; Company. ''We used it for a few clients and it worked out perfectly.''</p>
        <p>The trouble is, during an important time in the tax cycle, New York's site has disappeared -- ''temporarily unavailable,'' visitors are told, and it is not clear when it will be back. Marc Carey, a spokesman, said the  service was taken down to incorporate improvements after a test period that ran from Dec. 2 to 15.</p>
        <p>A chief issue appears to be security. Access had been granted simply on the basis of a name and Social Security number.</p>
        <p>The state is now telling visitors to the site, www.tax.state.ny.us,  (then clicking on online services) that ''based on your suggestions, we're revising the estimated tax account summary system.''</p>
        <p>While the state expects to restore the service this year, Mr. Carey could not promise that it would be restored by Jan. 18, the deadline for paying estimated taxes for the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Still, New York appears to be a pioneer in offering the service, said Verenda Smith, government-affairs associate at the Federation of Tax Administrators in Washington.</p>
