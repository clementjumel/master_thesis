        <p>New high-speed trains now make direct runs between Brussels and Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The trains, called Thalys (a made-up name, pronounced TAL-iss), are capable of speeds up to 186 miles an hour and take about 1 hour 25 minutes to travel between the airport and Brussels.</p>
        <p>The Thalys line now operates 25 times a day between Brussels and Paris, 21 times to Gare du Nord and 4 times to Charles de Gaulle Airport. The fare, $65 in second class and $103 in first class, and $56 in either class on weekends, is the same for service to downtown Paris or to the airport.</p>

        <p>New high-speed trains now make direct runs between Brussels and Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The trains, called Thalys (a made-up name, pronounced TAL-iss), are capable of speeds up to 186 miles an hour and take about 1 hour 25 minutes to travel between the airport and Brussels.</p>
        <p>The Thalys line now operates 25 times a day between Brussels and Paris, 21 times to Gare du Nord and 4 times to Charles de Gaulle Airport. The fare, $65 in second class and $103 in first class, and $56 in either class on weekends, is the same for service to downtown Paris or to the airport.</p>
        <p>Thalys service is available between Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne and Dusseldorf, and in summer, the high-speed service will be extended to Hanover, Germany, where Expo 2000 will take place from June 1 to Oct. 31. The Thalys fares are good  until at least March, and Rail Europe, which represents the European railroads in the United States, has announced that no increases are planned this year in fares for the Europass or the Eurailpass and its subsidiary passes -- the Flexipass, the Saverpass and the Youthpass.</p>
        <p>Eurailpasses are good in 17 European countries, and Europasses are good in up to 7 European countries. All of the passes are intended for purchase before travelers go abroad. These are good on Thalys, but reservations are required, for $25 or $13 extra.</p>
        <p>The price of the Eurailpass ranges from $554 for 15 days of unlimited rail travel to $1,558 for 3 months. The Europass costs $348 for 5 days of travel in a two-month period in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. More information: (888) 382-7245.</p>
