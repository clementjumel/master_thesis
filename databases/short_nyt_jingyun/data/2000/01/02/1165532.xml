        <p>DISTRUST of ethnic strangers runs so deep in Burundi that there is a special insult -- ''ikimenabanga'' -- for the person within a group who says too much, the one who breaks the secret. It is safer to stay quiet, to keep to one's own kind.</p>
        <p>But there is a great distance between that kind of simple suspicion and the hatreds that seem to have exploded in the last decade with relentless regularity in Burundi, Rwanda and eastern Congo -- the Great Lakes area of Africa. Documented genocide occurred there in 1994, when Hutu extremists in Rwanda meticulously slaughtered at least half a million ethnic Tutsi. The fighting continued in the form of a rebellion within Rwanda and spilled into Congo -- then known as Zaire -- helping to shatter that country in 1997. Burundi has been rent by civil warfare that started in 1993.</p>
        <p>Today, Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in 1994 are preying there again, in a war that has dragged in at least eight other nations. And in Burundi, Rwanda's southern twin, the Tutsi elite who rule the country have herded into hillside camps 350,000 people, most of them Hutu farmers, to separate them from Hutu guerrillas.</p>
        <p>All of this fighting makes the Great Lakes region one of the most grim and complicated places on earth, one where well-intentioned outsiders periodically wonder whether, and how, they might step in to halt the violence. Each time, the question comes down to this: Are these spasms of killing the result of old hatreds, or are they grotesque products of political manipulation?</p>
        <p>To many outsiders ''ancient tribal hatreds'' has been the formula easiest to accept, since it lends a patina of logic to indifference -- to saying that there is little that outsiders could do, even if they were willing. That is a position that underlay the outside world's inaction during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.</p>
        <p>But that is not what most experts on Africa say. The hatreds are real, the experts say, but they are not ancient at all -- and are not really different from ethnic conflicts anywhere else. In broad outline, the conflicts here are quite like those in the Balkans: Ancient divisions, even animosities, exist, but it takes a political elite to seize on them and transform them into something far more violent as politicians seek power for themselves.</p>
        <p>''It certainly is not ancient ethnic or tribal hatred,'' said Filip Reyntjens, a professor at the Universities of Antwerp and Leuven and a leading scholar of the Great Lakes region. ''That is a vision many Europeans and North Americans have because it is an easy way to explain what happens in Africa.''</p>
        <p>Scholars generally agree on the ethnic shape of the Great Lakes before the colonists -- first Germans, then Belgians -- arrived in the late 19th century. There were three distinct groups of people: the Hutu, who tended to be farmers (more than 80 percent today); the Tutsi, who arrived on the land later as nomads and tended to raise cattle (about 15 percent); and the Twa, or pygmies (perhaps one percent). There were rivalries, even animosities, but none of the episodes of ethnic killing that have scarred the recent past.</p>
        <p>Except for the Twa -- who were truly discriminated against -- the lines between Hutu and Tutsi were not always firm. The monarchies in pre-colonial Rwanda and Burundi were led by Tutsi but high court officials were often Hutu. Intermarriage was common, even if there were tensions between ruler and ruled.</p>
        <p>Along came the European colonists, who imposed their own ideas about race and superiority, and tended to put one group officially in power over the others. They preferred the Tutsi, who were viewed as taller, thinner, smarter (and thus more like the Europeans).</p>
        <p>''The Batutsi were meant to reign,'' wrote one Belgian administrator in the 1920's, according to the French author Gerard Prunier in his authoritative book on the genocide, ''The Rwanda Crisis''(Columbia University Press, 1995). ''Their fine presence is in itself enough to give them a great prestige vis-a-vis the inferior races which surround. It is not surprising that those good Bahutu, less intelligent, more simple, more spontaneous, more trusting, have let themselves be enslaved without ever daring to revolt.''</p>
        <p>What the colonists did, said Alison Des Forges, a historian and consultant for Human Rights Watch, ''was take this system that was relatively fluid and turned it into something very rigid and hierarchical.''</p>
        <p>BY the time the Belgians were preparing to withdraw from Rwanda and Burundi in the late 1950's, many experts argue, the lines between Hutu and Tutsi were firmly drawn, and resentment among the Hutu was strong.</p>
        <p>First, in Rwanda, Hutu clamoring for power killed many Tutsi in 1959; partly in response, the Tutsi elite in Burundi hardened their control. (The Rwanda fighting also created a group of Tutsi exiles whose children would become the guerrillas who took control in 1994.) In Burundi, a unifying figure, Prince Louis Rwagasore, arose among the Tutsi but was assassinated in 1961.</p>
        <p>After independence came to both nations in 1962, the polarization in both only increased with round after round of ethnic slaughters. People were killed merely for belonging to one ethnic group or the other, something that had never happened in either country.</p>
        <p>In Rwanda, that cycle came to a crisis under the presidency of Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu whose administration demonized all Tutsi as supporters of rebels fighting to oust him. His death in a plane crash in April 1994, in which the Burundian president also died, set off the 100 days of slaughter of Tutsis.</p>
        <p>Now the problems continue with the war in Congo and the seemingly intractable battles between the Hutu rebels and Tutsi leadership in Burundi. There is not a great deal of hope among most experts that the problems will be settled soon.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me that we are now in a situation where fear has become the most powerful spur to violence,'' Ms. Des Forges said.</p>
        <p>Still, these experts believe there is room for the outside world to become engaged. The ideal for beginning to rebuild trust, Ms. Des Forges said, is that outside nations find a way to guarantee that there will be no more ethnic slaughters in either country. For Rwanda, she added, the international community could show evenhandedness not only by continuing to bring the Hutu killers to justice but by not ignoring abuses committed by the Tutsi leaders.</p>
        <p>In Burundi, Jan van Eck, a consultant with the Center for Conflict Resolution in Cape Town, said that each party must have a place at the negotiating table -- an approach that seems to have been adopted by the new mediator to the conflict, Nelson Mandela, who has some experience as a uniting force in his own country, South Africa..</p>
        <p>Oddly, Mr. van Eck pointed out, the amount of blood already spilled may at this point become an argument for ending the violence. In Burundi, for example, so many people have blood on their hands -- Hutu and Tutsi alike -- that their own mutually awful pasts may offer an opening for starting anew.</p>
        <p>''They always said: Hang all the people who committed crimes, or shoot them,'' Mr. van Eck said. ''But now there is a realization that there might be too many.''</p>
