        <p>VETERAN investors in Latin American stocks know to keep their seat belts buckled. There is a lot of risk south of the border, and the stock price charts are wont to zigzag wildly.</p>
        <p>That they did in 1999, a year that began with most of the region enveloped in a deep recession set off by the 1998 Asian and Russian currency crises.</p>
        <p>Major indexes approached the end of 1999 with substantial gains, coming off the low levels of the previous year and helped by a year-end rally. For the year through Thursday, Mexico's Bolsa index was up 80.1 percent, Argentina's Merval was up 28 percent and Brazil's Bovespa was up 151.9 percent.</p>
        <p>As the new year begins, Latin American corporate profits remain spotty, but a group  of new Wall Street reports succinctly showcase Latin America as a place where investor opportunities look promising.</p>
        <p>A recent Merrill Lynch report had an ebullient subtitle: ''We've had the Pain; Now for the Gains . . . The Stage Is Set for a Big Year in 2000.'' And a Goldman, Sachs report urged investors to take a close look at both stocks and bonds, predicting that total returns ''will likely exceed those in both mature markets and possibly non-Japan Asia.''</p>
        <p>The risks -- from a possible inflationary spike in Brazil to worries about Argentina's fiscal deficit -- bring with them the potential for profits, especially because price-to-earnings ratios in Latin American stocks are roughly half those found among big-cap stocks in the United States.</p>
        <p>The positive view of the region is based on an improving regional macroeconomic picture. Rising prices in agricultural and industrial metal prices are improving trade balances in many countries. Inflation is expected to be very low in most of the region over the next several months, which should continue to bring down interest rates and tempt local pension funds to move their money from bonds to stocks. Most currencies in the area -- with the exception of Argentina's -- are competitive on international markets.</p>
        <p>On the political front, some new governments have or will be taking power over the next few months with fresh policies that Wall Street expects to be investor-friendly.</p>
        <p>According to Goldman, Sachs, the change in the region's gross domestic product will swing from a decline of 0.1 percent in 1999 to 4 percent growth in 2000. The firm also predicts that $38 billion in new portfolio investment will flow into Latin American stocks in 2000, up from $24 billion last year -- this in markets with a total capitalization of barely $400 billion.</p>
        <p>''We expect to see some modest but potentially very powerful increases in global investor allocations to Latin America in 2000,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, an equity analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Those inflows, he noted, began in mid-October, prompting the end-of-the-year rally in the regional stock indexes.</p>
        <p>Prospects for the region, not surprisingly, range greatly. Wall Street analysts generally favor Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico and Argentina, while they are generally bearish on Venezuela and Colombia, two countries with uncertain political outlooks. James Upton, Latin American equity strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said he liked the outlook for two Mexican companies involved in construction. One, Cemex, has a strong and growing market share in Mexico, has no real competition and has ''a brilliant distribution system,'' he said. It was trading near 52 Mexican pesos late last week; Mr. Upton says it can hit 61 pesos in 12 months.</p>
        <p>Another, Corporacion GEO, is a housing construction company that is poised to take advantage of the country's pent-up demand for low-income housing; Mr. Upton says it could rise 35 percent by year-end.</p>
        <p>MR. Upton also recommends Tele Centro Sul and Tele Norte Leste, two cellular phone spinoffs of Telebras, Brazil's state telephone company.</p>
        <p>Grace Pineda, a portfolio manager of Merrill Lynch's Latin America and Developing Capital Markets funds, said she was cautiously optimistic about 2000, although  ''we're always very skeptical when we have these strong rallies.'' She said she likes the Brazilian fixed-line and cellular telephone companies -- particularly Embratel -- as well as CBD, a Brazilian retailer. She also likes Televisa and TV Azteca, the two Mexican television networks.</p>
        <p>Jane Heap, vice president for Latin American equities at Deutsche Bank, likes the growth potential in several of the region's banks. She particularly favors Bradesco in Brazil, since it trades at a significant discount to its competitors and has several industrial holdings it can sell to increase  earnings. The stock, trading around 11.5 reals late last week, could reach 15 reals in 12 months, Ms. Heap said.</p>
        <p>She also saw Banco Galicia of Argentina and Bancomer of Mexico as two banks that could benefit from increased consumer demand for products like credit cards and mortgages. Ms. Heap thinks they will rise 30 and 42 percent, respectively, this year.</p>
        <p>But as always with Latin American stocks, there is that note of caution. ''Is stability ever assured?'' Ms. Heap asked. ''Well, prospects have certainly brightened.''</p>
