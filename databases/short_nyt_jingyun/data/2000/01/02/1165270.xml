        <p>Distant Road</p>
        <p>Selected Poems.</p>
        <p>By Nguyen Duy.</p>
        <p>Curbstone, paper, $15.95.</p>
        <p>Ably translated by Kevin Bowen and Nguyen Ba Chung, this bilingual collection presents an ample selection of the work of Nguyen Duy, one of contemporary Vietnam's most popular poets. Duy's poems focus on the ''inner wealth'' of the Vietnamese -- their love of the land, their steadfast reliance on one another, their decency and tenacity. He finds metaphors in clouds and bamboo, wind and sunlight, in the straw and stubble of a village or in a rice paddy, ''as vast and as unordered'' as one's heart. Duy fought in the Vietnam War, and many of the poems make direct reference to his experiences there; others focus on his country's struggle for economic and social well-being. In poems of bitter indignation and lyric sadness, he protests the corruption of the current government and laments the spiritual deficiency of Vietnam's new market economy: ''I'm frightened by fishy words that swim out from the mouths of great men.'' ''Distant Road'' is an extended love poem to Vietnam, and to the enduring nobility of its people.</p>
