        <p>Letter from Rhoda S Schaefer objects to implication in Geri Barish's Dec 26 letter that those who survive breast cancer have courage and will; says those who die also had courage and will (S)</p>

        <p>Like Geri Barish [letter, Dec. 26], I was disturbed by the Dec. 12 discussion of Barbara's Johnson's ability to serve in the Nassau County Legislature because she is a breast cancer survivor. What shocked and disturbed me even more was Ms. Barish's implication that those of us who have survived have ''mustered the courage and will to fend off the disease and continue to lead productive lives.'' Of the many relatives, friends and 1 in 9 founders and board members who have lost their battle with breast cancer, not one died because she lacked courage and will.</p>
