        <p>Philippe Entremont is celebrating a half-century of piano performances, as well as his success at conducting and recording,  with a world tour, making 30 stops in the United States, four of which are in New Jersey with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra this week.</p>
        <p>At these performances, he will play Beethoven's First Piano Concerto, rather than conducting the orchestra -- as he is to do when he leads the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra, which he now directs, on its tour of Japan. Another purpose of the tours is to publicize his recording of all five Beethoven concertos (on Vanguard Classics).</p>

        <p>Philippe Entremont is celebrating a half-century of piano performances, as well as his success at conducting and recording,  with a world tour, making 30 stops in the United States, four of which are in New Jersey with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra this week.</p>
        <p>At these performances, he will play Beethoven's First Piano Concerto, rather than conducting the orchestra -- as he is to do when he leads the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra, which he now directs, on its tour of Japan. Another purpose of the tours is to publicize his recording of all five Beethoven concertos (on Vanguard Classics).</p>
        <p>By playing German music while letting the orchestra take care of the Ravel on the same program, Mr. Entremont, who was born and trained in France, points up his cosmopolitan performing abilities.  In fact, at his 1950 debut recital in Barcelona, he played mostly works by Germans, namely Brahms and Schumann.</p>
        <p>He plays and conducts his share of French music, however, but with his range of roles and commitments, he must have been a little amused by a question posed to him for a commemorative booklet: ''Will it be simply more of the same?''</p>
        <p>The performances will be of works by Ravel, Haydn and Beethoven, at John Harms Center in Englewood, Thursday at 8 p.m.; Richardson Auditiorium of Princeton University, Friday at 8:30 p.m.; at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, next Saturday at 8 p.m.; at the State Theater in New Brunswick, next Sunday at 3 p.m. Information: (800) 255-3476.</p>
