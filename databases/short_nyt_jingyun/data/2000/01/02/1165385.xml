        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's hard to believe that after more than half a century, the story of Andy Williams dubbing Lauren Bacall's singing of ''How Little We Know'' in ''To Have and Have Not'' is still making the rounds. Suzanne Stone's letter [Dec. 19] only perpetuates the fable (and misidentifies the song as ''For All We Know'').</p>
        <p>Let's go to the film's director, Howard Hawks, quoted by Joseph McBride in the book ''Hawks on Hawks'' (1982): ''We had a hell of a time trying to find a girl to sing with as low a voice as Bacall's. So I got Andy Williams, and we took all the music he recorded and let Bacall mouth it to his singing. But she was singing at the same time, and I thought she sounded better than Andy Williams. So we went back and did the whole thing over again. It was all her singing. There was another picture where she sang, 'The Big Sleep.' And that was her voice too.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Ray Heindorf, Warner Brothers' musical director at that time, told a 1972 interviewer: ''Lauren Bacall did her own singing. A voice double was not used.''</p>
        <p>Many years ago, I asked Miss Bacall whether Mr. Williams had dubbed the song. Her answer could not have been more unequivocal: ''It was me!''</p>
