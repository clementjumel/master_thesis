        <p>Gregory Maffei's resignation as chief financial officer of Microsoft won't extricate him from a legal tangle that has put his interests at odds with those of his sister, Anne.</p>
        <p>Though he is leaving Microsoft to become chief executive of Worldwide Fiber, Mr. Maffei, 39, will remain as non-executive chairman of Expedia, an electronic travel service that Microsoft spun off in November. Ms. Maffei, 32, went to work last summer as an executive with Priceline WebHouse Club, an online grocery-shopping service affiliated with Priceline.com.</p>
        <p>Anne has much to gain, and Gregory to lose, if Priceline stops Microsoft from letting consumers bid on goods.</p>
        <p>In October, Priceline sued Microsoft and Expedia, contending patent infringement. Expedia said in its stock offering document that a decision in Priceline's favor ''would seriously harm our business'' and in December asked a federal court in Connecticut to dismiss Priceline's suit.</p>
        <p>In its complaint, Priceline contended that Microsoft had spent a year trying ''to learn as much about Priceline.com's business as it possibly could.'' If so, why hire the sister of Expedia's chairman? A Priceline spokesman said Ms. Maffei was not privy to matters related to the suit; Mr. Maffei could not be reached for comment.</p>
