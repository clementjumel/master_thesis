        <p>We were in a room, a spare studio, and Horst had this remarkable piece of furniture that he proceeded to drape me over every which way. He was very meticulous. He had a concept; it was my job to fit into it -- sort of like an actress with a director. He tells you how he sees it, and you find your way to doing it.</p>
        <p>I don't recall that he had that great a sense of humor. I always goof around a bit to make myself feel more comfortable, but he wasn't playing. This was just work, serious work. He was more intent on his camera and lights than on making conversation.</p>

        <p>We were in a room, a spare studio, and Horst had this remarkable piece of furniture that he proceeded to drape me over every which way. He was very meticulous. He had a concept; it was my job to fit into it -- sort of like an actress with a director. He tells you how he sees it, and you find your way to doing it.</p>
        <p>I don't recall that he had that great a sense of humor. I always goof around a bit to make myself feel more comfortable, but he wasn't playing. This was just work, serious work. He was more intent on his camera and lights than on making conversation.</p>
        <p>He was getting on, already a bit of a legend, and I was very much conscious of the honor of being photographed by him. And so it was: ''Yes, Mr. Horst. Yes, Mr. Horst.'' Being there made me feel very young and inexperienced.</p>
        <p>That was the thing with Horst: it was almost playing a role -- playing a movie star as opposed to shooting a picture of me. I suppose it was the way he treated me -- placing me and having the set already arranged. I remember feeling self-conscious in front of him, knowing that he had shot these huge female stars in the 40's and 50's. I felt I was pretending to be one of them.</p>
        <p>This is his photograph, not mine; his idea of glamour and what a star should look like. I was an object in it.</p>
