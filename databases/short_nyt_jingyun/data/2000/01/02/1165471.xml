        <p>THE SETTING -- Bundled and wrapped to fend off the biting air, Tuesday morning shoppers moved quickly through the glass doors at Tiffany &amp; Company on Fifth Avenue. The famous ''Tiffany blue'' boxes peeked out of shopping bags and coat pockets.</p>
        <p>Two women entering the store clutched their identical blue boxes and discussed how much money their boyfriends had spent on their Christmas gifts. One, giggling, said she had called to price the ring she had received.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- ''I don't know what it is about that little blue box, but it means something,'' said Harriet McDonald, who had come to the store to have a silver bracelet enlarged for her daughter. ''When you're 22, it's everything.''</p>
        <p>''I told my husband to forget Tiffany's for me and head to Fortunoff,'' she added. ''The markup here is crazy, and I've been married far too long to care about the little blue box.''</p>
        <p>But for some, presentation was everything, even if the gift itself hadn't come from Tiffany. Ms. McDonald mentioned a relative who kept the Tiffany boxes and bags after the Christmas gifts had been opened. ''We all knew what she was doing,'' she said. ''Who knows what we're going to end up getting next year in those boxes?''</p>
        <p>As Caroline Balavander told the tale of the mystery earrings, other shoppers nearby slowed down to listen. ''Just this Christmas,'' said Ms. Balavander, who is deeply familiar with Tiffany's offering, ''my mother received a pair of earrings in a Tiffany box.''</p>
        <p>''I remember thinking to myself, 'Gee, I've never seen those before,' '' she said. ''She doesn't have pierced ears, and you should have seen the look on their faces when she said she would return them for clip-ons.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Balavander was at the store, though, for another reason. ''My husband actually gave me the ring I really wanted,'' she said. ''I wasn't sure that he would, so I bought it for myself before the holiday just in case. This is a happy return.''</p>
        <p>Others had more than a Tiffany box on their minds. Julia Isfort and Christian Hullmann, two 20-something visitors from Germany, walked arm in arm out of the store. ''I know it's such a cliche but ever since I saw 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' I knew I had to get a ring here,'' Ms. Isfort said. ''We just put two gold wedding bands on hold.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hullmann added, with a smile:  ''We're going to get married before we really get married over in Germany. It's something just for us. Wish us luck finding a place to do it, though.''</p>
