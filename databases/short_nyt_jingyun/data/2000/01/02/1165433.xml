        <p>The price for the new minor league ball park now under construction by Suffolk County in Central Islip has risen by a million dollars.</p>
        <p>The additional money, which county Public Works Commissioner Charles Bartha said was needed to meet higher-than-expected building material costs, brought the cost to nearly $20 million. The amount includes a state grant of $14.4 million.</p>
        <p>The county will lease the 6,000-seat ballpark to the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League and expects to cover its $5.5 million investment in rent, ticket surcharges and other revenues. Opening day is April 28.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartha said the lease was still being negotiated.</p>
        <p>County legislators approved the additional spending in a 12-to-5 vote late last month, but some legislators are flashing anxious signals.</p>
        <p>Legislator Michael Caracciolo, a Republican from Riverhead, said the lease needed close scrutiny. He said he wanted team owners to invest in the ballpark project and perhaps share in the higher material costs.</p>
        <p>Other legislators chastised Mr. Bartha for not keeping them informed about project costs and pinned their support for the $1 million increase to assurances that they would be kept better informed.</p>
