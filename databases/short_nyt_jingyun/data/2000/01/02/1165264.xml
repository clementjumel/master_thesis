        <p>Dorothy Herrmann letter holds Dec 12, 1999 review of Susan Hertog's book Anne Morrow Lindbergh: Her Life makes false claim that author has written the first full-length study of wife of Charles Lindbergh; Herrmann says she wrote first full-length biography on Anne Morrow Lindbergh in 1992 (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The dust jacket copy of Susan Hertog's ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh: Her Life'' makes the false claim that the author has written ''the first full-length study'' of the wife of Charles Lindbergh. Your review (Dec. 12) perpetuates this error by citing a recent biography of the celebrated and controversial aviator and then stating that before the publication of Hertog's biography, his wife remained ''more of a mystery, managing to survive the prying of journalists, the publication of her diaries and letters and entire decades spent a good deal in the public eye.''</p>

        <p>Contrary to Hertog and her publisher's assertion, my biography ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh: A Gift for Life'' (1992) is the first full-length biography of the gifted writer. The Penguin paperback edition is still in print.</p>
