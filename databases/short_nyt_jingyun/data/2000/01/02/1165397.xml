        <p>The London String of Pearls Millennium Festival, a yearlong celebration of Britain's greatest social, political, cultural and technological achievements of the last 1,000 years, will allow access to 67 institutions along the River Thames.</p>
        <p>Some of the sites, which stretch from Greenwich to Kew Gardens, will open to the public for the first time. Among these are the Shipwright's Palace at Deptford, built by Henry VIII when he founded the Royal Dockyard in 1513; the British government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which will have 12 open days, and Lambeth Palace, home of the Archbishop of Canterbury since about 1200.</p>

There are behind-the-scenes tours at the London Weekend Television Studios, and a look at the BBC World Service and its impressive 1920's headquarters at Bush House Aldwich.</p>
        <p>Also, London Transport will be running trips to unused historical underground stations, and the Horse Guards building in Whitehall will be open for tours for the first time, allowing visitors to see the desk across which Hitler and Neville Chamberlain negotiated in 1938 and the office where Wellington planned the Napoleonic campaign.</p>
