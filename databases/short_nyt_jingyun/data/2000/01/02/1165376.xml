        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Paul Griffith's article on 20th-century music was thought-provoking [''With a New Century, a Promise of New Sounds,'' Dec. 19]. But I suspect that many people -- professional musicians as well as music-loving amateurs -- found one of its premises to be flawed, as I did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffiths says that music should not ''stalely repeat what had already been done.'' Well and good. But he assumes that the only way for composers to avoid hackneyed repetition and express themselves in an individual way is ''to do what composers have always done throughout the history of Western music: make a new sound.'' This simply shows his 20th-century bias. No great composer has ever said or indicated anything remotely like this, even such ''modernists'' (in their time) as Beethoven or Wagner.</p>
        <p>Rather, they let their music evolve from the music they had grown up with. Beethoven did not avoid major triads because Mozart had used them, nor did Wagner because Beethoven had used them. Only since Schoenberg have composers been so obsessed with newness that they deliberately eschew harmonic structures that have pleased musicians and audiences for 700 years. Is it a coincidence that, as Mr. Griffiths writes, the audience ''has shown itself perfectly capable of getting along without them''?</p>
        <p>Now that a composer can write anything, or even nothing (as in Cage's ''4'33''), and call it music, the task before today's and tomorrow's composers is to create not sound more bizarre than yesterday's but something individual and personal, whether elements of their language have been used by others or not. Only a mediocrity needs to find an utterly novel sound in order to come across as individual. As the producer and songwriter Arthur Freed said to Alan Jay Lerner: ''You don't have to be different to be good. To be good is different enough.''</p>
