        <p>Some may scoff and snicker at the mere mention of Frank DeVol, whose crowning professional achievement was to give the world the ''Brady Bunch'' theme. But even those who think the show marked some kind of nadir in Western civilization have to admit that the song was pretty darn catchy. As the music bounced along in tempo with those nine bobbing heads, the story of ''a lovely lady'' and ''a man named Brady'' became permanently etched in a generation's mushy consciousness.</p>
        <p>The rocker Ben Vaughn long ago learned to swallow his attitude about old-timey tunesmiths like DeVol. ''Oh, I'm a huge fan,'' says Vaughn. After years of playing the clubs, he landed gigs writing for NBC's ''Third Rock From the Sun'' and Fox's ''That 70's Show.'' Suddenly he had to forget everything he had ever learned from Bob Dylan and concentrate on squeezing tight bits of emotion into minute instrumental swatches. ''I love TV themes,'' Vaughn says passionately. ''Within 30 seconds to one minute, you have to sum up the musical identity of the show and why people would want to watch it for eight seasons. It's the ultimate miniature songwriting.''</p>

        <p>Some may scoff and snicker at the mere mention of Frank DeVol, whose crowning professional achievement was to give the world the ''Brady Bunch'' theme. But even those who think the show marked some kind of nadir in Western civilization have to admit that the song was pretty darn catchy. As the music bounced along in tempo with those nine bobbing heads, the story of ''a lovely lady'' and ''a man named Brady'' became permanently etched in a generation's mushy consciousness.</p>
        <p>The rocker Ben Vaughn long ago learned to swallow his attitude about old-timey tunesmiths like DeVol. ''Oh, I'm a huge fan,'' says Vaughn. After years of playing the clubs, he landed gigs writing for NBC's ''Third Rock From the Sun'' and Fox's ''That 70's Show.'' Suddenly he had to forget everything he had ever learned from Bob Dylan and concentrate on squeezing tight bits of emotion into minute instrumental swatches. ''I love TV themes,'' Vaughn says passionately. ''Within 30 seconds to one minute, you have to sum up the musical identity of the show and why people would want to watch it for eight seasons. It's the ultimate miniature songwriting.''</p>
        <p>Themes have long been a central element of a show's success. Try to imagine ''Dragnet'' without the dum dah dum dum or ''Peter Gunn'' without Henry Mancini's bleating, saxy crime-jazz. Still, the genre never seems to get much respect. By the early 90's, panicky networks were doing away with themes altogether, fearful that viewers would get so bored that they'd flick to cable.</p>
        <p>''There was some concern that theme songs were going to become this dying art,'' says David Bushman, a curator for the Museum of Television and Radio in New York. ''Pacing has changed so completely. It's very unusual to find a song like 'The Brady Bunch' or 'Gilligan's Island,' where you have this long exposition of the show.'' Themes got a respite in 1995, when ''I'll Be There for You,'' from ''Friends,'' became a huge pop hit.</p>
        <p>Still, those DeVol days of snazzy hard-sell jingles -- the aural equivalent of Brady teeth -- are, for the most part, long gone. Bushman likes to point out that TV history includes themes by jazz kingpins like Count Basie (the late-50's police drama ''M Squad'') and Duke Ellington (the short-lived 60's crime show ''The Asphalt Jungle''), as if that will ease the form's tinge of ignominy. DeVol himself was a more complex fellow than ''The Brady Bunch'' might suggest: he wrote scores for ''Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte,'' ''Pillow Talk'' and plenty of other films and TV shows, did orchestral arrangements for swing greats like Rosemary Clooney, Tony Bennett and Peggy Lee and played the band leader Happy Kyne on the 70's talk show spoof ''Fernwood 2-Night.''</p>
        <p>If TV themes -- and their authors -- ever get their proper due, Vaughn wants to start another campaign on behalf of incidental music. ''The Brady Bunch' incidental stuff is amazing,'' he says. ''It's so square, but underneath the corniest thing you've ever heard, there's a bass player and a drummer really working out.'' And hovering over them in the studio was a character named DeVol, who loved what he did no matter what the scoffers said.</p>
