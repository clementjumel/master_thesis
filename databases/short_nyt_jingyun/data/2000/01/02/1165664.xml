        <p>Basketball players added muscles and multimillion-dollar sneaker contracts. American yachts lost the America's Cup, gained it back, then lost it again. Grass all but disappeared on tennis courts. The natural stuff almost became extinct in baseball and football before injuries and nostalgia spurred its comeback. Lights finally shone at Wrigley Field. Europe became a major talent pool for the National Hockey League; golf and tennis benefited from America's diversity. What could happen next, on and off the field? A look at nine sports.</p>
        <p>By the time the century turns, betting on a horse race will be a 24-hour  affair and as easy as rolling over on a television remote control. Click --  handicapping information appears on the screen for races from Australia, England, Japan and the sport's new capital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Click -- bet. Click -- view race. Click -- grab the winning payoff from the A.T.M.-like slot at the bottom of the TV screen.</p>

        <p>Descendants of Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum will have realized the trailblazing horseman's dream of making sand rather than bluegrass the icon of the Sport of Kings, or should we say Sheiks? Geneticists will have helped by cloning faster, more durable racehorses in a never-ending assembly line.</p>
        <p>In the United States, only New York, California, Florida and Kentucky will feature live racing because the couch potato culture will be firmly rooted. America will be slow to embrace cloned horses and will lose ground because in-breeding will have thinned capable stock.</p>
        <p>Riders will have support teams --  nutritionists, psychiatrists and trainers -- dedicated to keeping them at the feathery weight of 114 pounds. There'll be a lot of hiring and firing. But best of all, technology will allow bettors to match fields from around the globe in virtual races. One thing will remain the same -- there will be more losing tickets than winning ones.</p>
