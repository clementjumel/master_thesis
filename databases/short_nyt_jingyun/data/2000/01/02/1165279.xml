        <p>I WAS finally at the end of an exhausting trip, a three-week zigzag from Romania to Lithuania, from Hungary to Poland and back, but in a few short minutes I would be on my way home.</p>
        <p>Home! I was wallowing in anticipation.</p>
        <p>It had been a hell of a trip, but also in many ways a trip from hell, marred by a series of odd mishaps that made me wonder if, after my more than 20 years on the road as a reporter and writer, the travel gods had suddenly turned against me.</p>
        <p>Of course, I had suffered mishaps before while traveling -- automotive break-ins and breakdowns; missed connections; illness on the road. But never in such a strange, sustained sequence.</p>
        <p>''Yo!'' a friend had just e-mailed from Milan in response to my message detailing the latest disaster: I had tripped and fallen while photographing the ruined synagogues in the southern Lithuanian village where my great-grandfather had been born. Trying to protect my cameras, I had crashed to the ground and twisted my ankle so that I could hardly walk.</p>
        <p>''Don't move!'' Francesco shouted across cyberspace. ''Stop getting hurt! Do nothing! Enough!''</p>
        <p>I was eager to heed his advice, and desperately eager to get this trip over with, before anything else untoward happened.</p>
        <p>The string of misadventures had started on a sunny Sunday afternoon 10 days or so before my spill, when I was bitten by a dog as I strolled along a crowded sidewalk in downtown Bucharest.</p>
        <p>The dog was on a leash, to be sure, and the two young women walking it claimed it had been vaccinated. But neither would give me her name or phone number, even though I followed them for blocks with my jeans leg rolled up to show the wound. Obviously to get rid of me, one of them finally wrote down the number of someone who, she said, could vouch for the animal's health. Contacted later, however, this person denied any knowledge of either the dog in question or its owner.</p>
        <p>Using my cell phone as I watched the women and their ugly little beast disappear into the crowd, I called a string of acquaintances and tried not to panic.</p>
        <p>One friend put me in touch with a local doctor, and I grabbed a taxi to his home.</p>
        <p>The doctor minimized the problem, but this did little to assuage my mounting anxiety. Ever since I saw the Disney movie ''Old Yeller'' as a child, I've had a terror of rabies, and Bucharest is a slightly scary place in this regard. The city is crawling with feral dogs, dirty, rough-looking strays that I had been eyeing nervously ever since I got to town.</p>
        <p>I traveled on to Budapest the next morning, and the doctor there immediately put me on a monthlong course of anti-rabies shots, just in case. Once symptoms appear, he solemnly explained, ''rabies is a 100 percent fatal disease.''</p>
        <p>Between the dog bite in Bucharest and my fall in Lithuania, meanwhile, I had dropped my laptop computer, damaging its power adaptor and making it impossible to use. The machine was functioning now, at least for the time being, thanks to emergency surgery performed by a very nice young man I tracked down, over a long holiday weekend, in an anonymous, outlying suburb of Warsaw.</p>
        <p>Still, despite the disasters, I had accomplished a lot on the trip.</p>
        <p>I'd given a well-attended lecture in Budapest and taken part in a Holocaust conference in Transylvania. I'd carried out a number of interviews and made a photographic documentation of Jewish heritage sites in three countries, including those in my ancestral shtetl. I was bringing back a notebook stuffed with material, a stack of business cards with addresses for new contacts, and nearly a dozen rolls of undeveloped film.</p>
        <p>The taxi pulled up at Vienna's Sudbahnhof, and I gathered my bags. I couldn't wait to get aboard the train, the overnight Remus, a Euronight sleeper that conveniently runs straight from Vienna to Orvieto, the local station for my home base in central Italy. I had booked a sleeping car -- my favorite way to travel -- and I looked forward to settling in, locking out the world, flipping through a magazine and drifting off to sleep.</p>
        <p>I made my way as quickly as possible through the station, but my progress was slow: I was still limping badly, and side effects from the anti-rabies shots made me woozy. Along with my suitcase, backpack and shoulder bag full of work material, I was shlepping an insulated baby food container carrying the vaccine for my next and final injection.</p>
        <p>At a kiosk near the track I stopped for a moment to buy a sandwich to take on board, then proceeded along the platform.</p>
        <p>Two minutes later, I realized that something wasn't right. I stopped, and tensed muscles and hunched shoulders in turn, counting straps and handles.</p>
        <p>One of my bags was missing.</p>
        <p>I was swept by a sense of relentless inevitability. It was the bag that I ''never let go of,'' the bag that I ''never let out of my sight'': the heavy, multizippered, black canvas shoulder bag containing my computer, my notes, my film, my addresses, my keys, and various other essentials.</p>
        <p>R EPEATING ''Oh, no!'' like a mantra, I rushed -- as much as I could rush under my laden, limping circumstances -- back to the kiosk. Nothing was there but the puzzled-looking proprietor, who had the audacity to smile.</p>
        <p>Five minutes later, I would have been safely on the train and heading home, but the angry travel gods had struck again.</p>
        <p>''Mein Arbeit!'' I moaned, to myself, to the kiosk man, to the extremely helpful woman who led me to the lost and found, and eventually to the police. ''Mein Arbeit! My work!''</p>
        <p>Sudden misfortune can teach you a lot about yourself. It can reveal your inner strengths -- and also your fragility.</p>
        <p>The dog bite, the injections, the twisted ankle, the broken computer, I had taken more or less in stride.</p>
        <p>My fall in Lithuania, in fact, had in the end almost seemed bashert -- fated, in a positive sense. It had slowed me up just enough so that when I got to the Jewish cemetery at the edge of the village, I encountered an old man passing by on a bicycle who not only remembered local prewar Jewish life but even apparently had known some of my distant relations.</p>
        <p>The theft of my bag, though, left me sobbing uncontrollably for the next two hours, as I stammered out a list of my losses to an officer. I could tell by his bland-faced lack of concern at what he was writing that he held out little hope that anything would be recovered.</p>
        <p>Calling a friend, I let the tears flow.</p>
        <p>''I just want to go home, I'll never get to go home,'' I wept. The most unsentimental of men, he performed the telephone equivalent of slapping my face to get me to stop. ''Yes you will,'' he told me. And of course, the next day, I did.</p>
