        <p>THE day before he resigned as chairman of the Westchester County Republican Committee last week, Nicholas A. Spano telephoned his counterpart in the Conservative Party to notify him. But indicative of the diminished relationship between the two parties, Mr. Spano's probable replacement is not politically to the liking of the Conservatives.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Spano's decision to resign is being viewed by some people as an effort by Mr. Spano, a state senator, to strengthen his own base with moderates to ensure that he will be re-elected next November. The Conservative Party had already pledged to abandon him.</p>
        <p>Vincent Natrella, chairman of the Westchester County Conservative Committee, called the probable new chairman, James E. Cavanaugh, the supervisor of Eastchester, ''a bright guy,'' but said his likely selection was just the latest example of a move by the Westchester Republicans in the direction of liberal Republicanism. For more than two decades, the Conservative Committee has tended to give its support to Republicans, but, Mr. Natrella said, ''If the Republicans are going to move to the left, we'll go back to running our own candidates.''</p>
        <p>In his letter of resignation, Senator Spano said that, in part, ''continuing state Senate obligations make it increasingly difficult to continue serving the Westchester Republican County Committee at a level the job both demands and deserves.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano had been chairman for five years, during which time the Democrats won control of the executive and legislative branches of county government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavanaugh is a former aide to Mr. Spano in the State Senate in Albany, public information officer for the Board of Legislators and a newspaper reporter. His selection could become official as early as Wednesday, when Republican leaders are expected to meet. Paul J. Noto, the Republican minority leader on the Board of Legislators, said the Republican Party was in need ''of a more moderate image'' and only with diminished influence from the Conservative Party is this possible. He said of Mr. Cavanaugh's apparent selection, ''It's a signal maybe that the Republican Party is moving away from the intolerance and extremism of the Conservative Party. The message here is no longer can these people in the Conservative Party intimidate the Republican Party, and that's a fairly significant message.''</p>
        <p>In his last two elections, Mr. Noto of Mamaroneck is one of the few Republicans on the Board not to be endorsed by the Conservative Party. But the Conservatives have also said that they would not endorse Senator Spano nor his brother, Assemblyman Michael J. Spano, because they have opposed a ban on a form of late-term abortion that Conservatives call ''partial-birth abortions.''</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Senator Spano needed the support of the Conservatives in his narrow victory over his then Democratic challenger, Thomas J. Abinanti of Greenburgh, the majority leader of the Board of Legislators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abinanti, who said he is seriously considering a run again this year, called Mr. Spano's resignation from his party position a ''desperate act'' akin to Bob Dole's resigning from the Senate to run for president. ''He's trying to shed his image,'' said Mr. Abinanti, who during the election four years ago had argued that it was a conflict of interest for Mr. Spano to be both a state senator and a party leader.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abinanti said that he was aware of rumors that Senator Spano was hoping to have Democratic support in his race for re-election, but that as far as he knew they were unfounded. These rumors surfaced last month when Senator Spano, as one of his last major acts as party chairman, used his influence to persuade four Republicans on the county Board to support the 2000 budget of County Executive Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat who is no relation to Nicholas Spano.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavanaugh said he looked forward to the possibility of becoming party chairman, calling it a ''tremendous opportunity to work to bring the Republican message to new voters.'' He added, ''My goal is to broaden our party's overall base, to reach out to new ethnic groups.'' He said we would stay on as supervisor of Eastchester, a job be has held since January 1994.</p>
