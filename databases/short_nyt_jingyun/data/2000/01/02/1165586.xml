        <p>Cuba did not celebrate the start of the third millennium today.</p>
        <p>This is not a political statement, even if the Communist Party's refusal to fade away after the collapse of the Soviet Union or the continuing United States trade embargo make Cuba feel like a time capsule crammed with dowager buildings and revolutionary slogans.

        <p>Cuba did not celebrate the start of the third millennium today.</p>
        <p>This is not a political statement, even if the Communist Party's refusal to fade away after the collapse of the Soviet Union or the continuing United States trade embargo make Cuba feel like a time capsule crammed with dowager buildings and revolutionary slogans. It is only an acknowledgement -- made on the front page of Granma, the official newspaper -- that since the Christian calendar began with the Year One, the new millennium actually starts on Jan. 1 next year.</p>
        <p>So while the rest of the world jumps the gun on the party, Cuba, Communist or otherwise, ever insistent on following its own political and social path, will linger in the 20th century for one more year.</p>
        <p>Contrary to rumors, neither Madonna nor the Three Tenors showed up in Havana on Friday night. There were no fireworks or huge crowds cheering on the stroke of 12, a result of both tradition and politics. Cubans traditionally spend New Year's Eve at home with friends and family, waiting until midnight to toss buckets of water out the window in a ritual that symbolizes saying goodbye to the past year's bad luck and hard times.</p>
        <p>And ever since Jan. 1, 1959, when the dictator Fulgencio Batista fled Havana, the New Year is more important for commemorating the day when cheering throngs embraced Fidel Castro and his triumphant revolutionaries.</p>
        <p>While Cuba officially remains on the verge of the millennium, its people have grown accustomed to the feeling of being on the cusp of a new era. They have learned to improvise and survive in an economy that, despite modest growth, has yet to lift their family situations. So it was that  an elderly artist chuckled as he reflected on whether the year 2000 held any special meaning for him.</p>
        <p>''Here, every day is the turn of the century,'' he said. ''The problem is tomorrow. Our preoccupation is tomorrow. What problems are we going to have tomorrow?''</p>
        <p>Recent weeks have brought contrasting flashes of yesterday and tomorrow. In numbers not seen since the early days of the revolution, tens of thousands of people have marched in boisterous rallies demanding the return of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old refugee who is at the center of a custody dispute between relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba. In the millennium's last cold war battle, some 100,000 protesters in the city of Santiago revived visions of the old revolutionary fervor on Thursday with their broadsides against American imperialism.</p>
        <p>''Cuba is in a time warp,'' said a diplomat. ''In the 21st century Cuba is not going to have Fidel. He is not going to be around forever. There is going to be a change and we would like to see it occur in a way that assures democracy and progress.''</p>
        <p>But reminiscent of the days before it started importing revolution, Cuba is eagerly importing tourists who sip daiquiris in new hotels or trot out their best high school Spanish as they bargain down the price of bongos or portraits of Che Guevara.</p>
        <p>Three hundred Italian and Canadian tourists ushered in the New Year under the dome of the stately Capitol building, which is used as a museum and convention center, feasting on Champagne and lobster.</p>
        <p>In Old Havana, several hundred tourists paid $100 each to dine under the stars in the plaza outside the cathedral, ringed by twinkling wreaths hanging from the balconies. As tourists, some in black tie and slinky gowns, roamed about, ordinary Cubans without the cash to join the bash looked on curiously from the roped-off entrances to the plaza.</p>
        <p>''What can I believe?'' said Yordanka Hernandez, who lives in a cul-de-sac off the plaza. ''They should do this for us, the Cubans. Instead, this is for foreigners. As a Cuban, imagine what I think. We earned it. We're struggling. Struggling for Elian.''</p>
        <p>In a building overlooking the plaza, small groups gathered in tiny apartments, clinking glasses of rum or dancing to music from boom boxes as they waited to eat their dinner of pork, rice and yuca.</p>
        <p>''We celebrate with what we have,'' said Roberto Leyva. ''Let everybody have their own way. Cubans live among brothers. He does not live thinking about the people out there.''</p>
        <p>He expected that the New Year observance would bring with it some official declaration about the revolution's challenges after 41 years.</p>
        <p>''The comandante will have to talk about the revolution in the millennium,'' he said. ''For me, this is the best. Here, there are no assaults, you can walk anywhere. Fidel has created this. If God exists, that God is Fidel.''</p>
        <p>Tourists flowed through the streets, as they do most days, taking pictures. Although street vendors grouse that the tourists often pass by looking but not buying, they are a source of much-needed hard currency. They also bring a curiosity about an island that is suffused with near-mythic meaning.</p>
        <p>''I am a disillusioned old-time Communist,'' said Allesandro Damiani, an Italian tourist who works for the European Community. ''I wanted to find out if ideology is stronger than climate and latitude, or the other way around. I found latitude and climate are stronger.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Damiani said Cuba's opening up to tourism was inevitable since the collapse of the Soviet Union, which helped subsidize the government here.</p>
        <p>But he also thought it was jarring to see class distinctions he thought had vanished with the revolution slowly arise between Cubans who work in tourism and have access to American dollars and Cubans who do not and are paid in Cuban pesos.</p>
        <p>One of those Cubans who has a few more dollars is Manuel Licea, a singer who first rose to fame in the 1950's with the island's top orchestras. Though he is fond of his smokes and rum-tinged espresso, he is still in fine voice, and has become famous again through his appearances on the wildly popular ''Buena Vista Social Club'' and ''Afro-Cuban All Stars'' recordings. Since then, he has traveled to Europe and the United States, playing the traditional Cuban music known as son for people who remembered it from decades past.</p>
        <p>''The century began with the son,'' he said. ''It will end with the son.''</p>
        <p>In the 1950's he used to greet the New Year in clubs, serenading tourists with irresistible guarachas that sent their hearts racing or dreamy boleros that brought tears. The songs, like one titled ''If You Cook the Way You Walk, I'll Eat the Scraps,'' also helped ordinary folks suffering under the dictatorship forget their worries.</p>
        <p>This New Year, though he was performing in Mexico, his thoughts were with easing the animosity between Cubans who have long been divided since the revolution split families and friends.</p>
        <p>''I hope for something miraculous in the millennium,'' he said during a rehearsal break at the Egrem Studios in Havana a few days ago. ''I hope the Cubans who are in other countries will reach an understanding between those who are here and those who are outside. Music, like sport, is something we can do to help that understanding. That is my dream. Before I have to go to where we all have to go, to at least see that for 24 hours. Then I can die.''</p>
