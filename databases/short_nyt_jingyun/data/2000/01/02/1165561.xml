        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Diamond Buyers Wonder: Is It Real or Treated? And Does It Matter?'' (Personal Business, Dec. 19), which explained how diamonds,  like colored gems before them, are  sometimes treated to alter imperfections:</p>
        <p>As a director of the American Gem Trade Association, I can tell you that my group has been at the forefront of disclosing enhancements of colored stones for well over a decade, before federal rules required. Our Gemstone Information Manual is in its seventh edition, and we offer brochures dealing with enhancements of emeralds, rubies and sapphires. We work diligently with the Jewelers of America and other industry associations to update them on the latest technological advances in treatment of colored stones, through video courses called ''Nothing to Hide.''  Persistence has paid off, and buyers of colored stones are now, for the most part, the most educated of consumers.</p>
        <p>As a dealer of colored stones, I was appalled to see the before-and-after pictures of a treated emerald accompanying an article that essentially dealt with diamonds and their enhancement. That is like comparing apples to oranges.</p>
        <p>ROBERT LINDER  Manhattan, Dec. 21</p>
