        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>DISGRACE, by J. M. Coetzee. (Viking, $23.95.) The ''disgrace'' of the title belongs to the central character of this novel (winner of this year's Booker Prize in Britain), a Cape Town intellectual whose sexual sin, later visited on his daughter, is made to reflect the old guilt of white privilege.</p>
        <p>EMPIRE EXPRESS: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad, by David Haward Bain. (Viking, $34.95.) An authoritative, engaging history of the gigantic enterprise that linked the coasts of America in 1869, and of the robber barons and immigrant workers who did it.</p>
        <p>THE GOODLIFE, by Keith Scribner. (Riverhead, $23.95.) A novel that ponders why crime stories so fascinate us while telling a hair-raising tale of a kidnapping gone wrong, using five narrative points of view without ever getting confused or woozy.</p>
        <p>MAILER: A Biography, by Mary V. Dearborn. (Houghton Mifflin, $30.) Norman Mailer carefully examined from without (no interviews) by a writer who appreciates the equal importance of his life and his work in understanding America in the second half of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>NAT KING COLE, by Daniel Mark Epstein. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $27.) A life of this American singer of tales follows its perpetually seductive yet profoundly reserved subject from boyhood (only gospel songs allowed) through 40's jazz prowess and 50's pop stardom to his untimely death.</p>
        <p>OSBERT SITWELL, by Philip Ziegler. (Knopf, $30.) An elegant, expertly written life of Sir Osbert Sitwell, an ineffable aristocrat with a temporary literary reputation and a permanent conviction that he, his sister Edith and his brother Sacheverell were made of superior clay.</p>
        <p>REMBRANDT'S EYES, by Simon Schama. (Knopf, $50.) A huge, digressive, learned, personal, often fascinating book defending Rembrandt's genius, as if it needed defending.</p>
        <p>THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE: Picasso, Provence, and Douglas Cooper, by John Richardson. (Knopf, $26.95.) Picasso's biographer takes time out to give an account of his own early life and his relationship with the rich and prickly art historian and collector Douglas Cooper.</p>
        <p>TERESA OF AVILA: The Progress of a Soul, by Cathleen Medwick. (Knopf, $26.) The saint (b. 1515) is drawn here as a flesh-and-blood human being -- a levitation-prone mystic who was also a hardheaded businesswoman adroit at securing financial angels.</p>
        <p>WALTER BENJAMIN AT THE DAIRY QUEEN: Reflections at Sixty and Beyond, by Larry McMurtry. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $21.) A peculiar book, part memoir, part tour de force, part commonplace book, in which the author of ''Lonesome Dove'' regrets what he thinks is his failure to subvert fallacies about the Old West.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>DISGRACE, by J. M. Coetzee. (Viking, $23.95.) The ''disgrace'' of the title belongs to the central character of this novel (winner of this year's Booker Prize in Britain), a Cape Town intellectual whose sexual sin, later visited on his daughter, is made to reflect the old guilt of white privilege.</p>
        <p>EMPIRE EXPRESS: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad, by David Haward Bain. (Viking, $34.95.) An authoritative, engaging history of the gigantic enterprise that linked the coasts of America in 1869, and of the robber barons and immigrant workers who did it.</p>
        <p>THE GOODLIFE, by Keith Scribner. (Riverhead, $23.95.) A novel that ponders why crime stories so fascinate us while telling a hair-raising tale of a kidnapping gone wrong, using five narrative points of view without ever getting confused or woozy.</p>
        <p>MAILER: A Biography, by Mary V. Dearborn. (Houghton Mifflin, $30.) Norman Mailer carefully examined from without (no interviews) by a writer who appreciates the equal importance of his life and his work in understanding America in the second half of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>NAT KING COLE, by Daniel Mark Epstein. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $27.) A life of this American singer of tales follows its perpetually seductive yet profoundly reserved subject from boyhood (only gospel songs allowed) through 40's jazz prowess and 50's pop stardom to his untimely death.</p>
        <p>OSBERT SITWELL, by Philip Ziegler. (Knopf, $30.) An elegant, expertly written life of Sir Osbert Sitwell, an ineffable aristocrat with a temporary literary reputation and a permanent conviction that he, his sister Edith and his brother Sacheverell were made of superior clay.</p>
        <p>REMBRANDT'S EYES, by Simon Schama. (Knopf, $50.) A huge, digressive, learned, personal, often fascinating book defending Rembrandt's genius, as if it needed defending.</p>
        <p>THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE: Picasso, Provence, and Douglas Cooper, by John Richardson. (Knopf, $26.95.) Picasso's biographer takes time out to give an account of his own early life and his relationship with the rich and prickly art historian and collector Douglas Cooper.</p>
        <p>TERESA OF AVILA: The Progress of a Soul, by Cathleen Medwick. (Knopf, $26.) The saint (b. 1515) is drawn here as a flesh-and-blood human being -- a levitation-prone mystic who was also a hardheaded businesswoman adroit at securing financial angels.</p>
        <p>WALTER BENJAMIN AT THE DAIRY QUEEN: Reflections at Sixty and Beyond, by Larry McMurtry. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $21.) A peculiar book, part memoir, part tour de force, part commonplace book, in which the author of ''Lonesome Dove'' regrets what he thinks is his failure to subvert fallacies about the Old West.</p>
