        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I wonder if Mr. Heizer has given any thought to his ''colossal'' project's impact on Nevada's rare and waning desert habitat? Or the unique plants, birds, insects and animals that call the desert home? Mr. Heizer apparently still thinks that swamps and deserts are mere wastelands ripe for him to drain and pave, an attitude that has been discredited as we learn about the critical role these habitats play in the health of an ecosystem.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I wonder if Mr. Heizer has given any thought to his ''colossal'' project's impact on Nevada's rare and waning desert habitat? Or the unique plants, birds, insects and animals that call the desert home? Mr. Heizer apparently still thinks that swamps and deserts are mere wastelands ripe for him to drain and pave, an attitude that has been discredited as we learn about the critical role these habitats play in the health of an ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimmelman acts as an accomplice to Mr. Heizer, variously describing the huge desert site as a ''void'' and ''the middle of nowhere.'' I cringed to read of Mr. Heizer's ''road graders, loaders, tractors and concrete mixers,'' the ''hundreds of thousands of yards of dirt'' he has whimsically moved, and the mistakes of his ''inexperienced construction crew.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Heizer had tried to build his egotistical monument on sensitive wetlands in, say, the San Francisco Bay area, or, for that matter, anywhere near a populated area, the story would be quite different. What's the difference between this ''art'' and the gold mines that are ripping apart the Nevada desert?</p>
