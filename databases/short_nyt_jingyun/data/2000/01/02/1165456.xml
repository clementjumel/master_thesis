        <p>With fashion so unpredictable, it's risky to project what the 2000's may have in store. But here are a few of 1999's most provocative styles that may just prove influential. The year had its share of curious ideas (right), from sequined dresses over jeans for day to the mixing of clothes by different designers to the revival of brash color, as in this ensemble of trash bags.</p>
        <p>The year's success was the designer bag (bottom right), with Hermes, Gucci and Fendi the leaders. Architectural clothes (below) gave wearers a shape other than their own, from Junya Watanabe's black coat and suit to Hussein Chalayan's mille-feuille-style dress. And ethnic dressing (left) mixed distinctive patterns and colors, from Chinese to Afrocentric.</p>
