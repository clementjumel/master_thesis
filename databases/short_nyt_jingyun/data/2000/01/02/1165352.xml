        <p>Englewood Hospital and Medical Center's frequent radio ads boast of a ''world class'' staff that treats patients with respect. But there is one class of patient that the hospital will no longer treat at all: the kind enrolled in a Blue Cross/Blue Shield health maintenance plan.</p>
        <p>The hospital -- citing what it called inadequate reimbursements and meddling in medical decisions for its HMO subscribers -- announced recently that it was cancelling its contract with Horizon Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Jersey and with Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New York, effective Feb. 22.</p>
        <p>''We determined that we are no longer going to accept their interference in patient care decisions,'' said Daniel A. Kane, president of the hospital. ''Secondly, from a financial point of view, they have repeatedly denied care that's already been provided, and in the cases of Empire, we've not had a rate increase in three years, and they're not interested in negotiating one. And in the case of Horizon, they've been negotiating for a decrease in their reimbursements.''</p>
        <p>Englewood is not alone. At least four other hospital companies -- accounting for a total of six hospitals in the state -- have cancelled their HMO contracts this year, and several others have threatened action.</p>
        <p>In addition to Englewood, Rahway and Elizabeth Hospitals have also dropped Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in Newark, the largest regional hospital in the state, cancelled its contract with Aetna U.S. Healthcare. And Cigna was dropped by Meridian Health System, which operates Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, Point Pleasant Hospital, Brick Hospital and Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank.</p>
        <p>Nor is the situation unique to New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''It is getting tougher to keep contracts,'' said Mohit Ghose, a spokesman for the American Association of Health Plans in Washington, a nationwide industry group.</p>
        <p>The cancellations reflect the increasingly tough negotiating positions taken by hospitals as their financial situations become more perilous. Aside from fewer lucrative deals with insurance companies, annual shortages in state reimbursments for charity care, plus Medicare cuts totalling $1.8 billion from 1998 to 2002 under the federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997, have taken a scalpel to hospital earnings in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>According to the New Jersey Hospital Association, which represents 112 hospitals, 60 percent of its members lost money in 1998. Englewood, for example, with a budget of $151 million, lost a total of $852,000. Morover, the association projected that 90 percent of its members would end 1999 in the red.</p>
        <p>John Lloyd, Meridian's president, who is also secretary of the hospital association, said: ''I think the hospitals have done their part and have made significant efforts to reduce costs and cannot continue to operate at reduced rates. I think that's the point that we're at.''</p>
        <p>In its annual report last month, the hospital association found that on average, members' revenues were 1.7 percent less than their expenses, a record operating loss for the group as a whole. At the same time, the state health department released findings that HMO's in New Jersey covered 63 percent of all varieties of treatment, as against 67 percent for the Northeast region and 61 percent nationally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kane, Englewood's president, who is also chairman of the hospital association, said the hospital cut its budget from $151 million in 1999 to $148 million for next year.</p>
        <p>Paul Langevin, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, which represents 10 insurance companies with 4.8 million subscribers, including 2.3 million in managed care plans, said canceled contracts should not come as a surprise when hospitals and insurers are both under pressure to keep down costs.</p>
        <p>''The incentives for plans and hospitals are in some cases diametrically opposed,'' said Mr. Langevin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Langevin did give hospitals credit for trying to improve their efficiency. But others have questioned their financial decision-making. In October, Standard &amp; Poor's lowered the credit rating of four New Jersey hospitals, including Englewood. Englewood and Pascack Valley hospitals were each taken down one notch by Standard &amp; Poors, from BBB to BBB-; Rahway went from BB to a negative outlook; and Holy Name was dropped from BBB+ to a negative outlook.</p>
        <p>Standard &amp; Poor noted that despite an overabundance of beds in northern New Jersey, hospitals continued to expand or build new facilities to attract greater market share. Englewood, for example, which  has 520 beds, is planning to build a $38 million ambulatory care facility next year. The hospital said the occupancy rate this year was 80 percent, as against a 58 percent average statewide.</p>
        <p>From the point of view of the Department of Health and Senior Services, contracts between hospitals and the various plans are not the state's business.</p>
        <p>But Tom Breslin, a department spokesman, said , there are some protections for consumers when the relationships fail. For instance, Mr. Breslin said a hospital must notify health plans of its intention to drop them 30 days in advance, and then must treat the plan's subscribers for an additional 90 days after that.</p>
        <p>To insure that subscribers have ready access to hospital care, Mr. Breslin said, health plans are subject to what is known as the 20-30 rule, under which 90 percent of policy holders must live within 20 miles or a 30-minute drive of a network hospital.</p>
        <p>For now, Englewood will continue to treat all emergency patients, regardless of coverage, as required by law, and will continue treating patients covered by Blue Cross/ Blue Shield's traditional fee-for-service plans.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard L. Salzer, an orthopedic surgeon who is president of the medical staff at Englewood, said the insurer sometimes resisted surgical procedures.</p>
        <p>''They seem to wish that you go through a course of physical therapy and maybe medication before they allow the diagnostic procedure to go forward,'' Dr. Salzer said.</p>
        <p>On one occasion, he added, a hospital staff member waited on the phone for a half-hour for an approval before she needed to to attend to a medical need. ''After 30 minutes on hold, I asked the patient if she could take the place of my staff member, and she spent an additional two hours on the phone,'' Dr. Salzer said.</p>
        <p>Fred Hillman, a spokesman for Blue Cross/Blue Shield, said the company had three other hospitals in its network, Holy Name and Valley Regional Hospitals and Hackensack University Medical Center, that will keep it in compliance with the 20-30 rule.</p>
        <p>From a broader perspective, Mr. Hillman said the company was not concerned that contract cancellations by Englewood and the other hospitals would adversely affect the company's financial health. He said Blue Cross/Blue Shield had contracts with 70 hospitals statewide, up from 53 when it began its managed care network in 1993.</p>
        <p>The popularity of managed care plans has also multiplied, he said, to 1.1 million enrollees in 1999 from 30,000 in 1953.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kane, Englewood's president, acknowledged that the contract cancellation meant little financially to Blue Cross/Blue Shield financially. But he said he hoped it would send a message to managed care companies that the hospital would not longer absorb losses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hillman suggested there was another message implicit in cancellation, which, after all, would result in turning away patients.</p>
        <p>''You can almost use the word desperate in the case of some of the hospitals,'' he said.</p>
