        <p>Goodluck Diigbo was well named, but when asked about the circumstances of his birth, he is uncertain of the details.</p>
        <p>''It was a Sunday,'' he said, pondering for a moment and chewing on his glasses. ''The 25th of October. I was told I was born the year before Nigerian independence, which was in 1960.''</p>
        <p>What he is certain of is that he has survived, by his count, seven attempts on his life by the Nigerian army in Ghana, where he eventually fled.</p>
        <p>Sitting in his modest but busy travel agency at 130 West 42nd Street, he told his dramatic story matter-of-factly, in a lilting Nigerian accent.</p>
        <p>One morning in May 1994 he arrived at his office at the Movement of the Survival of the Ogoni People headquarters in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, to find it surrounded by the army.</p>
        <p>He returned home, and a friend informed him that the leaders of the group, including his close friend, the prominent writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, had been arrested on murder charges. He was wanted on the same charges, and was advised to flee.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Diigbo did not leave immediately. Instead, he hid for the next two years, before fleeing to Ghana.</p>
        <p>The army was under orders to shoot him on sight for his activities on behalf of the Ogoni people in southern Nigeria. Mr. Saro-Wiwa, who was executed in 1995 despite an international campaign calling for his release, described Mr. Diigbo in a book he wrote in prison as ''quite a godsend'' and credited him with helping the movement enormously in its struggle against the Nigerian military regime and the environmental ravages he said were caused by Shell Oil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diigbo arrived in New York in September 1996, after he was granted political asylum by the United States. He spent his first 18 months in New York organizing conferences and speaking tours to raise awareness about the Ogoni situation.</p>
        <p>Then, in 1997, after he missed a flight to Ghana, his travel agent got him on another flight for the next day, and he was impressed. ''I got captivated,'' he said of the travel business.</p>
        <p>By March of last year, with financial support from friends, Mr. Diigbo had seen enough to enable him to open Goodluck Express Travel, which arranges travel anywhere in the world. With the profits, he wants to start an organization to aid in the resettlement of refugees.</p>
        <p>Does he associate his extraordinary tale with his name? ''Most of the time,'' he said, ''I am surrounded by an aura of good luck, almost like an overwhelming gift.''</p>
