        <p>Ever since it achieved independence from France in 1960, Ivory Coast has been considered a model of stability and prosperity in Africa. So it came as a shock, both in Africa and in France, when soldiers mutinying over low pay went on a looting spree and, one day later, a military junta announced a coup, the first in the country's history.</p>
        <p>The leader of the nonviolent coup, Gen. Robert Guei, a former armed forces chief ousted by President Henri Konan Bedie, said he took action largely because Mr. Bedie was creating ethnic divisions.</p>
