        <p>THIS time of year, predictions are as plentiful as Champagne corks, even in a city where profits get more attention than prophets and where, for most people, forecasting the future means knowing when to pack an umbrella.</p>
        <p>Yet fortunetelling is a vital component of most cultures, said Nan Rothschild, a professor of urban anthropology at Barnard College.</p>
        <p>''There are always things people can't control or explain, so they come up with rituals to alleviate the anxiety this causes,'' she said. ''Many immigrants bring with them techniques they've found helpful in other settings and change them to whatever the new setting is. Instead of guessing the best time to plant crops, it may be when to buy a lottery ticket.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a journey last week through the mystical corners of some ethnic communities showed how indigenous traditions, often ancient and sacred, are adapted to new settings. Within roughly one mile of each other in Queens are a Taiwanese man who uses lunar and solar patterns to predict the stock market, an Indian astrologer who uses her daughter's computer to calculate horoscopes, and a Haitian voodoo priest who reads chicken bones and drinks Bordeaux wine.</p>
        <p>''For many cultures, predictions and fortunetelling is not a superstition but a language or ritual for understanding the world,'' said Sandhya Shukla, an assistant professor of anthropology at Columbia University. ''Migrating to another culture only intensifies the need for these kind of languages.''</p>
        <p>URBAN TACTICS  Correction:  January 9, 2000, Sunday  A picture caption last Sunday about a Brooklyn rabbi who prophesied world peace in the seventh millennium of the Hebrew calendar misstated the year in which that millennium will begin. It is A.D. 2240, not 2040. (The year in the Hebrew calendar is 6001.)</p>
