        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Joyce Purnick (Metro Matters column, Dec. 27) asserts that today's students in New York City's public schools are ''less prepared and less motivated than students in past generations.'' But this is not, as Ms. Purnick suggests, the fault of students or their parents.</p>
        <p>As a fourth-grade teacher in East Harlem, I know my students deserve the highest level of instruction and materials but often don't get it. We lack school libraries, librarians and certified, qualified and experienced teachers.</p>
        <p>What we need is a commitment to supply all of the city's public school classrooms with the proper instructional materials and teachers who are more prepared and more motivated. But until the city is willing to pay for qualified and talented teachers, we will lose the best of them to the suburban school districts that surround the city.</p>
