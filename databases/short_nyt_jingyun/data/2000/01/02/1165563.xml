        <p>As 1999 trading ended in an anticlimactic fashion, the date buzzing an alarm in investors' ears may have been Monday, April 17, not Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Company, told Reuters on Thursday that some people, who were waiting for tax reasons, to take profits in January chose to do it sooner, fearing that the rally was ending. Some portfolio managers all of a sudden as we step into the New Year think that people will start to sell on the first day of the year, he said.</p>
        <p>Even though trading was thin on Thursday and Friday, when the market closed early, analysts said the urge to sell shares might be extended through earnings season this month and even into February as the Federal Reserve might raise rates then.</p>
        <p>Michael Lyons, listed equities trader at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, told Bloomberg News on Thursday that if people start selling stocks, the market will go down as fast as it went up.</p>
        <p>And up it went in 1999. At year-end, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets, the Dow Jones industrials were up 25 percent; the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, 20 percent; the Nasdaq, 86 percent; and the Russell 2000, 20 percent.</p>
