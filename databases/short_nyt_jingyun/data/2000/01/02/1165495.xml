        <p>For schoolchildren in the 1950's or 60's, there were few sounds more terrifying than the wail of an air raid siren. No matter that it was only a test: The sound will forever conjure up visions of Soviet jets and mushroom clouds.</p>
        <p>But 50 years after cities from coast to coast installed the early warning systems, the sirens have become little more than annoying relics of the cold war. This year, Baltimore will become the latest city to abandon the system and its tests of 122 sirens that blared from speakers around town each Monday at 1 p.m. A new network of radio-controlled sirens, which do not require routine testing, will be installed to alert people to impending natural disasters or terrorist attacks.</p>

        <p>Other cities have put the old systems to similar use. Tornado-prone Omaha tests its system once a month, and San Francisco, which is prone to earthquakes, runs a test every Tuesday at noon. But why anyone would need a siren to tell them that there had been an earthquake is an open question.</p>
