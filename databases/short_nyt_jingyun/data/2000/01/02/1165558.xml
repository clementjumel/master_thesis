        <p>Investors, long smitten by the low-cost, near market-matching attractions of index funds, may finally be losing some of their enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>According to Lipper Inc., the research firm, net new investments in index funds that track the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell considerably for November, to $600 million from $3.25 billion in October.</p>
        <p>Lipper said that was the slowest pace of cash inflows into index funds since the summer of 1998, when the stock market was in a correction. But the most recent slowdown occurred during a month when equity markets were rising sharply.</p>
        <p>Part of the money is probably going into individual growth and technology stocks, or into funds that specialize in those kinds of stocks, said Edward S. Rosenbaum, research director at Lipper. Indeed, science and technology funds saw net flows of $8 billion in November, nearly two-thirds of the net flows into equity funds.</p>
        <p>For 1999, large-cap growth and multicap growth funds returned 35.8 percent and 48.3 percent, respectively, through Dec. 23, far ahead of the 19.4 percent gain of the average S .&amp; P. 500 index fund. Mid-cap growth and small-cap growth funds did likewise, returning 67.6 percent and 55.6 percent, respectively. Science and technology funds returned 128 percent.</p>
        <p>Still, such fund-hopping does not make much sense, Mr. Rosenbaum said. ''Taking money out of the S. &amp; P. 500 to play growth or technology is a silly thing,'' he said. ''People may not be aware of how growthy the S. &amp; P. is.''</p>
