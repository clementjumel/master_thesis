        <p>Severance Hall, home of the Cleveland Orchestra, reopens Saturday after a two-year restoration. The building, containing a 2,000-seat concert auditorium and a 400-seat chamber hall, was opened in February 1931 and named for Elisabeth Severance, the wife of John Severance, the president of the orchestra's board.</p>
        <p>Hand-painted murals, gilt ceilings and marble wainscoting have been restored, and the main stage was refurbished. The original pipe organ is also being restored but it will not be ready in time for the reopening.</p>
        <p>The orchestra plans a six-week program of concerts to celebrate the new splendor. On Saturday, the music director, Christoph von Dohnanyi, will conduct works by Wagner, Vaughan Williams and Ravel. The next night chamber music by Schumann, Brahms and Stravinsky will be performed; the pianist in all three works will be Leif Ove Andsnes.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 13, 14 and 15, Mr. Dohnanyi will lead ''The Damnation of Faust'' by Berlioz, with the mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore. The Cleveland Community Gospel Chorus joins the orchestra in a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Jan. 16, and the soprano Sylvia McNair will sing Ravel's ''Sheherazade'' on Jan. 20, 22 and 25. The resident conductor, Jahja Ling, will conduct Bruckner's Eighth Symphony Feb. 3 through 6.</p>
        <p>The reopening events end with a family concert at 1:30 p.m. Feb. 12, featuring the Cleveland Orchestra and its Youth Orchestra playing works by Vaughan Williams, Prokofiev and Gabrieli.</p>
        <p>Tickets range from $25 for chamber concerts to $300 for the Saturday opening. Tickets to most regular performances cost between $19 and $58. The Jan. 16 King concert is free but reservations are required.</p>
