      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on various campaign proposals for using federal budget surplus; warns that if current spending levels are not cut this year, and rise at rate of inflation, ten-year surplus shrinks to $250 billion, or even less; recalls enduring lesson of Reagan years, that it really does take smoke and mirrors to produce tax cuts, spending initiatives and balanced budget all at the same time</p>

        <p>For two decades, American politics were defined by what David Stockman, the Reagan-era budget director, memorably proclaimed to be deficits as far as the eye could see. With the arrival of this new year, the United States economy will shortly break the record set in the 1960's and achieve the longest boom in history. As a result, political candidates are now debating how to spend surpluses rather than how to reduce deficits. But the new game can be as tricky as the old one. The true size of any surplus is debatable. Even its existence is provisional, depending on yet unrealized spending cuts. So far the presidential candidates are more interested in talking about what a surplus might buy than in the painful choices that lie ahead.</p>

        <p>For two decades, American politics were defined by what David Stockman, the Reagan-era budget director, memorably proclaimed to be deficits as far as the eye could see. With the arrival of this new year, the United States economy will shortly break the record set in the 1960's and achieve the longest boom in history. As a result, political candidates are now debating how to spend surpluses rather than how to reduce deficits. But the new game can be as tricky as the old one. The true size of any surplus is debatable. Even its existence is provisional, depending on yet unrealized spending cuts. So far the presidential candidates are more interested in talking about what a surplus might buy than in the painful choices that lie ahead.</p>
        <p>All four major presidential candidates agree that $2 trillion of a projected $3 trillion in budget  surpluses should be used to pay down the national debt or otherwise set aside for Social Security. All of them also have ambitious schemes for the remaining $1 trillion.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore would use the money for health care, education, military spending and other initiatives. Former Senator Bill Bradley would focus most of it on health. Gov. George W. Bush would use most of the money for a tax cut and military spending, and Senator John McCain would spread it out for spending and tax cuts.</p>
        <p>But none of the candidates emphasize what Congress will have to do to make these dollars materialize. These figures assume that Congress and the president will agree to steep budget cuts in domestic and military programs as envisioned in the Budget Act of 1997, with its notoriously tight caps on expenditures. In fact, the caps from that law have been circumvented in each of the last two years.</p>
        <p>If current spending levels are not cut this year  and are instead allowed to rise at the rate of inflation, the 10-year surplus shrinks to $250 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If Congress sets aside as much for ''emergency'' spending as it has in the last two years, the projected 10-year surplus would shrink to less than $50 billion. These numbers could improve later this month, when new economic forecasts are due, but the hard reality remains. Producing trillion-dollar surpluses will require cuts in existing domestic programs.</p>
        <p>It is true that discretionary domestic spending has been shrinking. In theory, there ought to be room for the next president to advocate some increased spending for anti-poverty programs, schools, environmental improvement, law enforcement and other areas, without provoking a political firestorm. But the costs of federal retirement programs and health care are exploding. The Congressional Budget Office projects that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, now 45 percent of the federal budget, will grow to 65 percent by 2030.</p>
        <p>With the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary only a few weeks away, voters must start demanding that all the presidential candidates face up to these realities when they talk about using the surplus for either tax reductions or new health plans. But voters may turn out to be less interested in these subjects than in the question of who can keep the economy cooking.</p>
        <p>One lesson from the Clinton years is that an expanding economy can do more than any social program or tax cut to improve the lives of Americans. An enduring lesson of the Reagan years, of course, is that it really does take smoke and mirrors to produce tax cuts, spending initiatives and a balanced budget at the same time.</p>
