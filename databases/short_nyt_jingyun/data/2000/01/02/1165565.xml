        <p>Annie O. Plummer, a housekeeper in Savannah, Ga., whose single-minded campaign to distribute thousands of free dictionaries to needy schoolchildren made her nationally known as ''The Dictionary Lady,'' died Dec. 23 at her home. She was 63.</p>
        <p>Ms. Plummer died of lung cancer, said Edward L. Ellis Jr., pastor of the First Bryan Baptist Church of which she was a member.</p>
        <p>One morning in 1992, Ms. Plummer was struck by the fact that pupils were empty-handed while walking to the Garrison Elementary School in Savannah near where she lived.</p>
        <p>No books.</p>
        <p>It occurred to Ms. Plummer, who had been an outstanding student in the late 1970's when she returned as an adult to complete her education at the Richard Arnold Community School in Savannah, that if these children were given a basic book like a dictionary, it would help stimulate their interest in learning and could change their lives.</p>
        <p>Ms. Plummer started the project modestly when she used $50 of her own money to buy 30 pocket dictionaries. Borrowing a slogan from the United Negro College Fund, she painstakingly wrote in each book, ''A mind is a terrible thing to waste. I challenge you not to waste yours.''</p>
        <p>She later told a reporter, ''I went to the corner and started giving them out.''</p>
        <p>A local newscaster publicized Ms. Plummer's efforts and soon she began to receive donations. To raise more money for the project, Ms. Plummer began selling Dictionary Lady T-shirts for $10 each and helped organize a Dictionary Walkathon. Churches and community organizations chipped in to buy and distribute still more dictionaries.</p>
        <p>A shrewd businesswoman, Ms. Plummer persuaded one dictionary publisher to sell her a number of copies of the $5.95 book for just 65 cents each.</p>
        <p>By 1995, Ms. Plummer's stated aim was to provide every third-grade student in Savannah and surrounding Chatham County -- about 4,000 in all -- with a free dictionary.</p>
        <p>She told a reporter that by 1996 her informal organization had not only met that goal but had distributed more than 17,000 copies of a paperback dictionary.</p>
        <p>Gradually, the idea spread across the country. Ms. Plummer was featured in articles in Southern Living and People magazines and was visited and praised by well-known people like Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf.</p>
        <p>Susan Weiner, a former mayor of Savannah, said of Ms. Plummer: ''Here's a lady who didn't wait for government to do the job. Good for her!''</p>
        <p>To date, 32,800 books have been distributed, and now there are at least six ''Dictionary Ladies'' heading similar drives in communities around the country, including Detroit, Chicago and San Diego. The program's Web site is: http://savannahnow.com /community/dictionarylady/</p>
        <p>The Dictionary Lady Foundation, which was incorporated in Savannah in 1997, now provides guidance to branch organizations. ''We are hoping to get helpers in every town and school district throughout the world,'' said Barbara Dorsey, Ms. Plummer's daughter, who said she plans to continue with her mother's work.</p>
        <p>Annie Oneta Plummer was born on Oct. 17, 1936, in Sylvania, Ga., the fifth of 12 children of a truck driver and a housekeeper. She was raised in Savannah and dropped out of school in the ninth grade when she became a mother.</p>
        <p>As a single parent seeking to provide for herself and her daughter, Ms. Plummer went to work as a housekeeper. She soon became involved in neighborhood campaigns like getting a traffic light installed at a busy intersection.</p>
        <p>Eventually Ms. Plummer returned to school and received her diploma in 1978.</p>
        <p>In addition to her daughter, who lives in Savannah, Ms. Plummer is survived by a grandson.</p>
        <p>Ms. Plummer was passionate about black history. In honor of her vigorous lobbying, a bill to foster the teaching of black history at state schools now before the Georgia House of Representatives has been named ''HB 1492 -- Annie Plummer Act.''</p>
