        <p>Discussing the request for single-sex swim times at a town-owned pool in West Hempstead, Lee Boyar wrote [letter, Dec. 26] that accommodation of such a request ''would also be inappropriate if the religious practice [possibly motivating the request] were imbued with ultra-conservative belief about women.'' The request may be sound or unsound, and granting the request may be wise or unwise, but surely the decision cannot be based on the political correctness of the beliefs held by those who made the request! I cannot think of any grounds for resolving this matter that would be more ''inappropriate'' than that.</p>
