        <p>At midnight on Friday, while the screams of millions of partygoers rocked the city, James Karb, a 36-year-old Manhattan resident, was celebrating, too -- but much more quietly. He and about 100 others skipped the usual big night out and spent the final hours of 1999 meditating at the New York Shambhala Center, a Tibetan Buddhist center in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>''I wanted something peaceful to bring in the New Year,'' said Mr. Karb, a high school science teacher who said he had been meditating for a few years. ''I definitely didn't want to be part of the craziness. I wanted to be in a more centered spot.''</p>

        <p>At midnight on Friday, while the screams of millions of partygoers rocked the city, James Karb, a 36-year-old Manhattan resident, was celebrating, too -- but much more quietly. He and about 100 others skipped the usual big night out and spent the final hours of 1999 meditating at the New York Shambhala Center, a Tibetan Buddhist center in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>''I wanted something peaceful to bring in the New Year,'' said Mr. Karb, a high school science teacher who said he had been meditating for a few years. ''I definitely didn't want to be part of the craziness. I wanted to be in a more centered spot.''</p>
        <p>So, apparently, did thousands of other New Yorkers, who turned down invitations to parties and instead spent New Year's Eve at churches, at synagogues, at meditation centers, at concerts of sacred music, and at Jewish Sabbath dinners.</p>
        <p>While New Year's Eve is primarily a secular holiday, it has a spiritual aspect for some faiths, including members of the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches.</p>
        <p>For Jews, Friday night, as always, was the start of the weekly Sabbath. Some synagogues organized large group Sabbath dinners. Other observant Jewish families simply spent Friday night the way they always do -- together, at dinner.</p>
        <p>Ayelet Mehlman, said she and her family -- her husband, Aaron Mehlman, who is the rabbi at Ohav Sholom synagogue on West 84th Street, her three young daughters, and her aunt -- gathered for her usual, lavish Friday night dinner.</p>
        <p>''In the end, the best nights are the ones you spend with your family,'' she said, after describing a menu of homemade gefilte fish, chicken mole and apple kugel. ''In Times Square, they're trying really hard to have a good time. Here, we don't have to try so hard.''</p>
        <p>At Shout for Joy, a small Baptist church in the Bronx, some 60 worshipers did not have to strain to have a good time, either, said Gloria Green, the pastor. ''We just prayed to the Lord and felt the glory,'' said Ms. Green, who said she gave a sermon on another version of ''Y2K -- Yes to the King.''</p>
        <p>Despite the variety of the worshipers' New Year's Eve celebrations, all agreed that the best part was the atmosphere of community and sacredness.</p>
        <p>Nancy Begnel, 44, a health-care consultant, attended St. Bartholomew's, an Episcopal church on East 50th Street. ''It was wonderful,'' she said. ''So moving.'' With the idea of beginning the New Year with health, a healing service was held there, and -- atypically -- nearly all 300 worshipers waited in line to be prayed over, yet nobody seemed to mind, Ms. Begnel said.</p>
        <p>And if a New Yorker can smile while waiting in line, there has to be hope for peace in the city in 2000.</p>
