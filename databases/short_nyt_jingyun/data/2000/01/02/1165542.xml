        <p>The mass murderer had spent much of the past month hiding in a drainage culvert and later a cave. He looked haggard. His clothes were dirty and wrinkled and wet. He was holding two satchels, one filled with eggs, the other with apples.</p>
        <p>He introduced himself. ''I am Javed Iqbal, killer of 100 boys,'' he told the receptionist in the lobby of the newspaper office. ''Please tell someone in the reporting section that I have come to surrender.''</p>
        <p>The receptionist recalls being unsure what to do. Was this pathetic-looking man really Pakistan's most notorious killer? Or merely some bothersome fool?</p>
        <p>The hour was late, just after 9 p.m. Deadlines were pressing. Ten minutes passed before a reporter was finally summoned, and he was staggered at the scoop. He invited Mr. Iqbal, scourge of this entire nation, upstairs for questioning.</p>
        <p>And that is how it came to an end Thursday, the frantic monthlong hunt for a vengeance-seeking confessed killer, a man who enticed young teens -- most of them beggars and runaways -- to his tiny apartment in historic Lahore. He fed them and entertained them and asked their life stories and took their snapshots. Then he suffocated them, later dissolving their bodies in large vats of acid. He poured the residue in an alleyway sewer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Iqbal, 38, a wealthy, tormented man, kept an annotated list of his deeds, with his victims' names and ages and the dates of their deaths. He kept piles of clothing and shoes taken from his victims. When, by his count, he had killed 100, he stopped.</p>
        <p>''I could have killed 500, this was not a problem, money was not a problem,'' he told reporters and editors in a small office as they recorded his words. ''But the pledge I had taken was of 100 children, and I never wanted to violate this.''</p>
        <p>The ''pledge,'' he said, was an act of revenge against the police. He repeated an account he had written in an earlier confession, of how two young servants had beaten him up badly last year, of how the police had ignored his complaints and instead accused him of sodomy, something he had been charged with before.</p>
        <p>He decided that the killing of children would be his means of retribution. ''In this way, I would take revenge from the world I hated,'' he said of his six-month homicidal binge. ''My mother cried for me. I wanted 100 mothers to cry for their children.''</p>
        <p>He succeeded.</p>
        <p>Early this month, as news of the crimes became public, parents lined up by the thousands to rummage through huge piles of rumpled clothes and old shoes that had been found in Mr. Iqbal's apartment. Some found items that had belonged to their missing sons. Others merely saw their children's photos spread across wobbly tables at the police station. Or they read the morbid details in Mr. Iqbal's diaries. Parental grief became a daily spectacle as more and more people complained, ''Why can't the police find the killer?''</p>
        <p>Criticism of the police has been immense, with riots in Lahore.</p>
        <p>In late November, Mr. Iqbal actually turned himself in to a policeman, who ignored his confession as a fantasy. The murderer then sent his incriminating diary and photos to the newspaper The Jang, whose reporters, on Dec. 2, were the first to search his apartment and find evidence of the crimes. By then Mr. Iqbal was a fugitive, though notes he left behind indicated that he intended to drown himself.</p>
        <p>He surrendered on Thursday at the three-story offices shared by the The Jang, an Urdu-language publication, and its sister paper, The News, which is written in English.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Iqbal's request, the army was called to take him into custody rather than the police. At the time the police were announcing that they had arrested two men suspected of being accomplices of Mr. Iqbal. The two, Muhammad Shahzad and Muhammad Nadeem, were caught trying to cash a traveler's check in the name of Javed Iqbal. They admitted that they were helping the killer hide out in the culvert and the cave, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Iqbal, who lived off the money from the sale of a family business, contends that he was helped him in the murders by various confederates, including one who has already died in police custody. On Thursday the killer said that many of the victims were made to inhale a mixture of cyanide and acid as they slept.</p>
        <p>''I myself wore a mask, and after about five breaths, the sleeping victim would be dead,'' he said. ''Then my friends would place the body in a container and later drain it away.''</p>
        <p>According to The Jang and The News, Mr. Iqbal was unrepentant as he told his story. He was calm as he was led away. ''I am a relieved man today,'' he said, even as he acknowledged that his fate was likely to be the gallows.</p>
        <p>He reflected on his actions as heroic, something in the long-term public interest. He remarked how easy it was to dispose of the bodies of his victims in the large vats of acid. Such easily abused chemicals are a great danger to society, Mr. Iqbal said.</p>
        <p>''What if terrorists learned of these things?'' the mass murderer fretted.</p>
