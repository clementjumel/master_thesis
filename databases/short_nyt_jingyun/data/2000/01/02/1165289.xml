        <p>Harry Callahan, the abstract photographer from the Midwest, and Raghubir Singh, the realist from Rajasthan, are not on the same page, metaphorically speaking. One was Western, the other Eastern. One looked inward, the other outward. Callahan, an influential teacher of photography at the Institute of Design in Chicago and the Rhode Island School of Design, had important predecessors (Laszlo Moholy-Nagy), colleagues (Aaron Siskind) and students (Linda Connor, Ray K. Metzker, Emmet Gowin). He photographed weeds in water and scarred walls, but mostly, over and over again, in exposure and double exposure, he shot the body of his wife, Eleanor, as an intimate landscape. Singh, meanwhile, often complained of the ''wholly Western,'' angst-ridden nature of photography, saying, ''The Indian photographer had to cut his own route.'' He photographed Benares, Bombay, Calcutta, Kashmir -- landscapes teeming with bodies and buildings and public ritual.</p>

        <p>And then there was color. Callahan worked mostly in black and white and drained out the grays, once saying he ''really didn't want to think in terms of reality with color.'' Singh said he sought the ''Indian view of life'' resonating ''with sparkle, with illusion, with lively pictorialism'' -- or, as he once put it, ''the Ganges side of modernism.'' Singh wrote, ''The eyes of India see only in color.''</p>
