        <p>Only Vladimir V. Putin knows for certain where he wants to take Russia as the nation's acting president. But if his visit last week to the federal Railways Ministry is any indication, Russia may be in for an interesting trip indeed.</p>
        <p>As the Moscow daily Kommersant reported, Mr. Putin performed the rote ceremonial duties at a packed meeting of ministry employees eight days ago, doling out awards and praising the railroads' contribution to the economy.</p>
        <p>But then his tone turned icy. Why, he asked, did the railroads beseech the Kremlin for money when certain customers got special shipping discounts? And was it not odd that the ministry had granted certain unnamed people the rights to collect a mountain of unpaid freight bills? And why was the ministry buying rails from Japan when Russia's steel mills were idle and offering fire-sale prices?</p>
        <p>Then he left, even before the flustered deputy prime minister for industrial policy could read remarks congratulating the Kremlin on its victory in that week's parliamentary elections.</p>
        <p>The extraordinary scene suggests there is more than one way to look at Mr. Putin's pledge, made even before he became president on Friday, to restore a strong central government to Russia.</p>
        <p>Among Westerners, that promise mostly raises fears of a crackdown on civil liberties or a return to authoritarian rule, fears fanned by Mr. Putin's direction of the savage war in Chechnya. But his admirers insist that what he truly wants to subjugate is the fantastically corrupt Russian bureaucracy and economy.</p>
        <p>There is little doubt which is the tougher task. President Boris N. Yeltsin held immense power, but under his rule the ties between the Kremlin and major state agencies, provincial governments and industries steadily atrophied.</p>
        <p>The national tolerance of corruption -- bribes, after all, were sometimes the only way to accomplish anything under Soviet rule -- allowed bureaucrats to ignore Moscow's dictates and to accumulate fortunes at the same time.</p>
        <p>Moreover, much of the bureaucracy remains under the control of Soviet-era bureaucrats who are either ideologically opposed to the Kremlin or simply indifferent to its demands.</p>
        <p>''To this day, the power structures of our country remain, according to the method of work and the personnel that they have, in conflict with the new regime,'' said Anatoly A. Sobchak, the former St. Petersburg mayor who is regarded as Mr. Putin's mentor. ''These aren't democratic structures that live in a democratic state and are merely in opposition to the democratic state.''</p>
        <p>The new president, he said, ''is capable of making these power structures loyal and to make them work for the new democratic Russia.''</p>
        <p>Russians have heard all this before, of course, as recently as 1991, and it has yet to come to pass. And Russians have swallowed promises of strong, benevolent and progressive rule, from Nicholas II to Stalin, only to see them end up in chaos or autocracy or both.</p>
        <p>The new president will inherit near-dictatorial powers in the constitution which his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, pushed into law after thwarting a communist-led coup in 1993. Mr. Yeltsin never fully used those powers, either because of physical or political infirmity or out of a belief they were not needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin says he does not believe a new constitution is needed now. But he also has indicated that he wants to make changes through the system using the new plurality he won in Parliament in last month's elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin indicates in his writings that he believes Russia cannot become an advanced nation until it roots out Soviet traditions and bridges the divide that pits the communist third of the nation against the democratic remainder.</p>
        <p>In a special document, ''Russia at the turn of the millennium,'' published on a Kremlin internet site (www.pravitelstvo.gov.ru/english /statVP_ engl_ 1.html), he said that Russia would be mistaken not to recognize communism's accomplishments. ''But it would be an even bigger mistake not to realize the outrageous price our country and its people had to pay for that Bolshevist experiment.''</p>
        <p>''Russia needs a strong state power and must have it,'' he wrote. But a strong state, he added, means ''a law-based, workable federative state.'' And crucial to that, he added, are a streamlined and corruption-free bureaucracy, a merit system for hiring and rewarding government workers, a more powerful judiciary and closer ties between Moscow and its regions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin backed up his call for reform with some sobering statistics: even if Russia's per-person gross domestic product were to rise by 8 percent per year for the next 15 years, he wrote, the nation would still only reach the level of present-day Portugal. Achieving the level of Britain or France would require a 10 percent annual growth rate -- and even then, Britain or France would have to stand still.</p>
        <p>Investment has dwindled: only 4.5 percent of the nation's industrial equipment was less than five years old in 1998, compared with nearly 30 percent in 1990. Except in the electricity and raw-material industries, individual productivity is one quarter of that in the United States.</p>
        <p>Such shortcomings can be overcome, he said, but only by devising and swiftly carrying out a plan for the nation's restructuring and recovery. ''The paramount word is fast,'' he wrote, ''and we have no time for a slow start.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobchak, who recruited Mr. Putin to a team of economic experts when he was St. Petersburg's reformist mayor in the early 1990's, said the new president would benefit from his years as an intelligence agent in East Germany, where he was in regular contact with Western businesses and governments.</p>
        <p>''He is a convinced supporter of the market economy,'' Mr. Sobchak said. ''But in contrast to the majority of Russian politicians, he knows the western model of economic and political life not as a outsider but from the inside.''</p>
        <p>''He will not blindly transfer some of the recommendations of the West onto Russia. And I don't think he'll repeat the mistakes we made in the beginning of the 90's,'' when the country plunged into capitalism without the system of laws and government regulations needed to sustain it.</p>
        <p>Rather, Mr. Sobchak said, he expects Mr. Putin to follow the example of two American presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who amassed state power over the government and economy to shape the capitalistic system that exists today.</p>
        <p>Theodore Roosevelt took on entrenched monopolies, helping small businesses to thrive and competition to flourish. Franklin Roosevelt reworked the federal government to aid the poor, improve education and create a less crash-prone financial system.</p>
        <p>''His decisive interference in the economy during the Depression saved America,'' Mr. Sobchak said of Franklin Roosevelt. ''I think Putin has a wonderful opportunity to become for Russia what the Roosevelts are for America. And if he does this, he'll become the great president in the history of the country.''</p>
