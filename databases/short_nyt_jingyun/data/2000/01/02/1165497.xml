        <p>One of the country's largest producers of kosher wine will close its Williamsburg operation and relocate to Bayonne, N.J. The company was pushed out by the appetite for new house among the rapidly growing Hasidic community, the owner said.</p>
        <p>''We are still New York boys and we would love to stay, but we are not wanted,'' said David Herzog, the chief executive of the company, named Royal Wine Corporation but commonly called Kedem after one of its labels.</p>
        <p>The State of New Jersey offered Royal $600,000 in grants and $8.1 million in low-interest loans to move to Bayonne. Mr. Herzog said he told city officials he would prefer to stay in Williamsburg if the city agreed to lease him the abandoned Schaefer Brewery so he could expand the business. But the city never made him a firm offer, he said, and last Monday he signed a deal to buy a 180,000-square-foot warehouse in Bayonne.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the city's Economic Development Corporation said that the brewery is unavailable because the city is considering it for housing. It added that it had discussed alternative sites in the city and financial aid with Mr. Herzog, but that he was only interested in the brewery.</p>
        <p>During the 1997 election, Mayor Giuliani promised Hasidic residents and local politicians he would consider the brewery site for new housing.</p>
        <p>''I understand the city has pressure from the community for housing and it's a tightrope to juggle,'' Mr. Herzog said.</p>
        <p>Councilman Noach Dear said he was still pushing the city to try to keep the company and the jobs, mostly held by Hasidic Jews, in Williamsburg. ''The city can't afford to lose companies like this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Assemblyman Vito Lopez, a Democrat who endorsed Mayor Giuliani and who has won financing for thousands of units of housing in Williamsburg and Bushwick, disagreed. ''There is such a high demand for housing in Williamsburg that affordable housing would be a priority over the retention of jobs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Royal Wine, which moved from Czechoslovakia to New York in 1948, employs about 100 workers at the height of the bottling season, just before Passover. It will expand to at least 140 workers at the seven-acre Bayonne site, where it will move in May.</p>
        <p>Bayonne has been waging an aggressive campaign to lure midsize businesses that cannot find industrial space in New York. Last spring, the city enticed Imperial Bag and Paper of Hunts Point, the Bronx, to cross the Hudson.</p>
        <p>''Companies are having a hard time finding space in New York,'' said Michael O'Connor, executive director of the Bayonne Economic Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connor said his city was after more than just the jobs Royal would bring: ''David Herzog promised he'd help get us a kosher deli.''</p>
