        <p>Joyce Purnick's view that the loss of a stable and politically organized middle class is fundamental to the dysfunction of the public school system in New York City (Metro Matters column, Dec. 27) reminded me of something a friend who is a teacher says: No politician or school official will ever admit that a big part of the problem is poor home environments.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Joyce Purnick's view that the loss of a stable and politically organized middle class is fundamental to the dysfunction of the public school system in New York City (Metro Matters column, Dec. 27) reminded me of something a friend who is a teacher says: No politician or school official will ever admit that a big part of the problem is poor home environments.</p>
        <p>Teachers who have to be social workers, marriage counselors, welfare advocates and crisis mediators can't have much time or energy left to teach. Add to that the political realities Ms. Purnick mentions and school  administrators poorly equipped to tackle their jobs, and you ask yourself, How can any real learning ever take place?</p>
