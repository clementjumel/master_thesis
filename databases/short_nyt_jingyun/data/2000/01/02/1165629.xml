        <p>Sending a harsh message to followers of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, Chinese authorities gave prison sentences ranging from 7 to 18 years to three men and a woman who were said to be top organizers. Last summer the government declared the group an ''evil cult'' after 10,000 members mounted an illegal demonstration in Beijing.</p>
        <p>Two of the sentences -- 18 years for one defendant and 16 years for another -- were stiffer than those meted out to democracy advocates in the last several years, a sign of how frightened the government is of a movement that has attracted millions of citizens.</p>
