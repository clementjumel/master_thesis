        <p>THE president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donohue, visited 140 cities in 1999. And as a former Eagle Scout, he likes to be prepared for the inevitable hitches.</p>
        <p>His briefcase contains an elaborate array of toiletries and first-aid gear -- ''my travel-everywhere packet'' -- as well as vitamins, a two-year appointment calendar, schedules for basketball and hockey games at Washington's MCI Center, a road atlas, earplugs and a small screwdriver for repairs to eyewear.</p>
        <p>''I could fix your glasses,'' he volunteered.</p>
        <p>The first-aid supplies also come in handy for Mr. Donohue, who was born in Brooklyn and worked as an emergency-room attendant at St. John's Univeristy. ''He thinks he's Marcus Welby,'' an aide said.</p>
