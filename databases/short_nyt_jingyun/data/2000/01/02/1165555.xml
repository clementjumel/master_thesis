        <p>There is, after all, a market for those Year 2000 bears and millennium sweatshirts languishing on store shelves. At least two international corporate barter companies, which swap surplus goods and services among a large roster of clients, see profits in millennial castoffs.</p>

        <p>There is, after all, a market for those Year 2000 bears and millennium sweatshirts languishing on store shelves. At least two international corporate barter companies, which swap surplus goods and services among a large roster of clients, see profits in millennial castoffs.</p>
        <p>''It's our opinion that some of these items will become collectibles,'' said Bill Levitz, a managing director of Argent Trading in Manhattan. Argent, he said, may hold onto any promising stock up to 13 months, hoping that it will accrue value.</p>
        <p>A nearby competitor, Atwood Richards Inc., isn't confining itself to millennial trinkets. The company is also buying older computers and medical monitors that might not be Year 2000 compliant, said Moreton Binn, the chief executive. Atwood upgrades the machines and sells them to Eastern European countries that aren't too picky, he added.</p>
        <p>Beyond speculation, why do people want millennial surplus? ''It's like, what do you do with the Easter Bunny after Easter?'' Mr. Binn said. ''You move it to places where people don't give a hoot about bunnies -- all they care about is chocolate.''</p>
