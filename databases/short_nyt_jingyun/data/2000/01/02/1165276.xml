      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In a sense, the aerial photographs of Yann Arthus-Bertrand are happy accidents: he took them from aircraft in 60 countries, and composition on the fly is chancy. But the prints are proof that, if the earth itself is not alive, its whole surface is always moving. Wind, water, tectonic plates and people are slow agents, but the marks of change are vast; the images capture eons in a moment. Whether you look down on the Lakagigar volcanoes in Iceland or the man-made windbreaks of the Aran Islands, you know Galileo said more than he meant when he insisted, ''It moves.'' Almost 200 of Arthus-Bertrand's images are lavishly reproduced in EARTH FROM ABOVE (Abrams, $65). The project was sponsored by Unesco, and the book has commentaries by French scientists who worry about humanity covering the planet too fast. But the photographs undermine their eloquence; to paraphrase John Lyly, the pictures are honey though the words are gall. From above, acres of carpets laid out on the sands of Morocco or even the dumps of Mexico City are as gorgeous as the autumn forests of Quebec or the mineral ''forest'' of Madagascar. Shots of the sprawl of monstrous cities are not reassuring, but over all one marvels at how naturally humanity's endless sand-castling fits into nature. And what a work nature is! Everywhere -- in cosmic brush strokes of bacteria in the Grand Prismatic Spring of Yellowstone or minerals washed over by the Rio Carrao in Venezuela -- the earth creates color and patterns that reduce human art to its proper place. ''Earth From Above'' is translated from French (by David Baker), and here and there one is reminded of the pitfalls of translation, as when it tells us the Yankees are ''the most winningest team'' in baseball, and of how iffy proofreading is in any language, as when it says the Maldives are ''120 isles or islets, of which almost 420 are inhabited.'' But it is a terrific book to look at and think about.</p>
