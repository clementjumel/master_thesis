        <p>Every year they're confronted with the same vexing situation at Ladies' Home Journal: so many fabulous women, so little time. It was the same case a few months back, when the magazine's editors sat down to figure out  their choices for the fourth annual broadcast of ''Ladies' Home Journal's Most Fascinating Women'' -- and how to include them all in the one-hour special, which is to be shown tomorrow night at 10.</p>
        <p>Some names, of course, tend to keep popping up. ''We had Hillary on the first show,'' said Myrna Blyth, editor in chief of Ladies Home Journal, ''but she remains fascinating year after year. She's always doing something or having something done to her.'' Ms. Blyth helped conceive the show as a way of translating the magazine to television.</p>
        <p>The show's producer, Susan Winston, said: ''It's hard not to keep looking at Oprah Winfrey. We restrained ourselves this year because we had so many terrific people.'' People like Susan Sarandon; Jodie Foster; Lisa Kudrow of ''Friends''; J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter children's  books; and the soccer star Mia Hamm. The goal was to reflect Ladies' Home Journal's long-stated motto, ''Never underestimate the power of a woman.''</p>
        <p>The number selected generally ranges from 8 to 12. The search committee's methods are fairly straightforward. Ms. Blyth, who chose 12women for 1999, explained: ''We look over the events of the past year and pick the women who have been prime movers. We ask who WAS fascinating?''</p>
        <p>Strengthening the connection between the show and the magazine, the honorees are grouped in categories like ''Hot, Hot, Hot'' and ''In the News,'' the names of regular features in the 116-year-old monthly. This year the ''Hot, Hot, Hot'' honorees include the teenage pop star Christina Aguilera and Ms.  Kudrow. ''In the News'' takes in Laura Bush, Ernestine Bradley, Tipper Gore and Cindy McCain. And Ms. Sarandon and Aretha Franklin represent women ''who, as we say in the pages of the magazine, are better than ever,'' Ms. Blyth said.</p>
        <p>One of lesser-know honorees for 1999 9oa doe 199adies Home Journal's fascinating women of 1999 is Linda Armstrong, the mother of Lance Armstrong, cancer survivor and Tour de France winner who was Barbara Walters's choice as the most fascinating person of the year on a program broadcast in November.</p>
        <p>In previous presentations, Ladies' Home Journal honored Whoopi Goldberg; Rosie O'Donnell; Celine Dion; Sarah Ferguson, the former royal daughter-in-law turned Weight Watchers spokeswoman; Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright; and Pat Owens, the mayor of Grand Forks, N.D., who lobbied successfully for disaster relief and a visit from President Clinton when her town was ravaged by floods. ''What is interesting is that we're celebrating  women who have done things that are inspiring and are also women who are easy to relate to,'' Ms. Blyth said. ''They're women about whom you can say, 'I like her.' The woman who achieves is not always the perfect beauty or the 18-year-old.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone who fascinates the  editors at Ladies' Home Journal is fascinated by the prospect of taking part in the special. In the midst of her legal travail, Monica Lewinsky turned down a request to be part of the show. This year Cher declined. ''We really wanted her,'' Ms. Winston said. ''She really hit the comeback trail this year. She keeps re-inventing herself. You go, girl! Unfortunately, she was on tour in Europe. Not that we wouldn't go there, but she just didn't have the time.''</p>
        <p>The show, whose host this year is Roma Downey, star of ''Touched by an Angel,'' consists of taped interviews with the honorees and, when appropriate, film and concert clips. There is no presentation of trophies, plaques or free-form statuary. ''We're Lucite-free,'' Ms. Winston said.</p>
        <p>There was some discussion of Ms. Blyth's making an appearance on the show she helped conceive. ''It didn't even occur to me,'' she said. Not even as one of the year's most fascinating women? ''Oh, give me a break,'' she laughed. ''I AM fascinating, but come on.''</p>
