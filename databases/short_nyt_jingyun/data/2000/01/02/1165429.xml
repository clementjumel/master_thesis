        <p>Remembering the anxiety she endured when she put her wedding together five years ago, Claudia Hanlin, a 34-year-old former strategic managing consultant, vowed to simplify the famously nerve-racking experience of coordinating a wedding. Ms. Hanlin recently opened the Wedding Library, a research refuge at 50 East 81st Street (212-327-0100), where brides-to-be can browse through bound portfolios of photographers, caterers, florists, stationers, makeup artists, bakers and calligraphers and also hear tapes from bands and watch videos of weddings for inspiration. ''I wanted to offer people a chance to see some great suppliers without overwhelming them,'' said Ms. Hanlin, whose library is open free to the public. Suppliers, who pay to be included in the archive, provide everything from a society band for a lavish Pierre Hotel soiree to a Porta Potti for a barefoot-on-the-beach reception, but Ms. Hanlin thinks it's important to keep the number of options manageable. ''We try to find the supplier to fit the need of every kind of bride,'' she said. ''I got hundreds of photography portfolios and narrowed it down to 10.''</p>
