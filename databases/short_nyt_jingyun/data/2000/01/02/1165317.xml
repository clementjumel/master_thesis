        <p>America has spent the past several years acknowledging the indisputable heroes of World War II: the G.I.'s who stormed Omaha Beach, liberated concentration camps, fulfilled Gen. Douglas MacArthur's pledge to return to the Philippines and so much more. But members of that same generation who led the modern civil rights movement have yet to receive the same treatment, and portrayals of them still often give off a whiff of un-Americanism, a lasting effect of the 1950's Red scare, which labeled as a Communist rabble-rouser anyone -- and certainly any black -- who threatened the social order. It's a troubling paradox when considering the lives of three extraordinary, yet dimly remembered, heroes of the civil rights movement: James Farmer, Daisy Bates and Frank M. Johnson Jr.</p>
        <p>It's rarely noted that the civil rights movement of the 1950's and 60's was a direct, even inevitable, outgrowth of World War II. Blacks made up about 9 percent of the troops, and when they came home from defending democracy abroad, they were not about to put up with injustice at home. Soldiers who came back to crusade for equal rights included Medgar Evers, Oliver Brown, Hosea Williams, Ralph Abernathy, Edward Brooke and Carl T. Rowan.</p>
        <p>James Farmer, however, was different: he was a conscientious objector who stood up in 1941 at age 21 against segregation in the U.S. military and founded the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) a year later. An aggressive and gifted organizer, Farmer led America's first civil rights sit-ins for racial integration. And in 1961 he captained the Freedom Riders, who journeyed through the Deep South pushing for desegregation by openly violating seating rules on interstate buses. Attacked in Alabama, imprisoned in Mississippi and nearly lynched in Louisiana, Farmer seldom wavered from his die-hard pacifist beliefs. ''We are fighting back,'' he said. ''We're only using new weapons.''</p>
        <p>Daisy Bates used similar metaphors. ''Little Rock was a war zone,'' Bates would say, ''and we were its foot soldiers for democracy.'' When she was an infant, her mother was apparently raped and then murdered by three white men, and her father quickly fled in fear, never to be seen again. She learned of the act when she was 8, and it bred in her a passion for justice, which she put into practice most through activist journalism. In September 1957, she and her husband, L. C. Bates, and their newspaper, The Arkansas State Press, had already been pressing the issue of desegregating the state's schools when nine students were chosen to try to attend nearby Central High School. Every morning they would congregate at Bates's home to steel their nerves, and return after classes to share stories with Bates of how they had been kicked, spit on or shoved down the stairs that day. She, meanwhile, faced down threats of her own, including a cross-burning on her roof and a rock crashing through her window with a note attached: ''Stone This Time. Dynamite Next.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the most effective weapon in the battle for civil rights was the federal courts, especially as presided over by a Republican white judge whom Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said had ''given true meaning to the word 'justice' '': Frank M. Johnson Jr., who was instrumental in sweeping away the last vestiges of the South's Jim Crow laws. He was known as the judge who gave moral heft to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, and his later desegregation rulings sparked vicious reactions from white supremacists; the Ku Klux Klan deemed him ''the most hated man in Alabama.'' A cross was burned on his front lawn and his mother's house was firebombed, but he ignored the threats and allowed the famous voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery in March 1965.</p>
        <p>Farmer, Bates and Johnson were a part of ''the greatest generation'' that happened to serve the country at home. We are rewarded by their efforts every time a teenager walks into an integrated high school or protesters march freely or an elderly black woman takes the first available seat on the bus.</p>
