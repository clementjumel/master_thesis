        <p>For some executives, a yearly compensation package that includes a cash bonus must seem positively quaint. These days, most chief executives are asking for and receiving stock options as the predominant form of long-term incentives, according to Howard B. Goldsmith, vice president at the Segal Company, a human relations consulting concern in Manhattan. In its annual executive compensation report on companies with up to $200 million in revenue, Segal found that the stock-option warriors -- those whose compensation came primarily from stock options -- were in the high-technology area.</p>
        <p>As a group, chief executives of these companies were paid 3,156 percent of their salary in stock options last year, Segal reported.</p>
        <p>To be sure, stock options are well represented in all eight industry areas tracked by Segal. On the low end, leaders of companies in the fabricated metal/ wood area had to settle for options that amounted to just 37 percent of salary. Even so, those chief executives earned $288,000, on average, in 1999, in salaries and cash bonuses; that is $8,000 more than their high-tech counterparts. ''Upside potential and risk,'' Mr. Goldsmith said, ''that's what stock options are all about.''</p>
