        <p>John A Koskinen, chairman of President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, says that for last two months he has been quite confident of a smooth rollover to year 2000 by nation's computers; arranges to be in an airliner when the air traffic control system encounters year 2000; photo (M)</p>

        <p>It was three hours before midnight on Friday and John A. Koskinen did not appear worried a bit. His head was back. His eyes were closed. And a flight attendant aboard the last Delta Shuttle flight of 1999 from New York to Washington was urging him, to no avail, to return his seat to the upright position.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me, sir,'' the attendant said, pulling at the seat. ''Excuse me.'' It was three hours before midnight and the federal government's Year 2000 coordinator, President Clinton's point man on the potentially debilitating computer problems, was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>That is not to say that Mr. Koskinen was not taking the arrival of the new year seriously, or that he had written off the possibility of devastating computer trouble. ''Some people have said, 'Why does this guy look so relaxed?' '' Mr. Koskinen said. ''If I had any worries, they were at the beginning. The last two months, I've slept well every night.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koskinen, a former government budget official and corporate turnaround expert, had been on the job for more than a year and a half when the big moment finally arrived. He had held countless strategy sessions, conference calls, tests, drills, press briefings, public hearings and closed-door meetings. And even his brief shut-eye aboard Delta Flight 1769 was work-related. By catching a nap aboard the nearly empty flight, Mr. Koskinen was reassuring the public about the safety of the nation's airlines.</p>
        <p>He had arranged his quick trip to La Guardia Airport and back so he would be in the air at 7 p.m. Eastern time -- midnight in the world of aviation, when the air traffic control system encountered the year 2000.</p>
        <p>''Happy New Year,'' he said casually when the big moment arrived. The 727 he was aboard kept flying. He settled into his seat. As far as crises go, this one was a snoozer.</p>
        <p>The federal government's round-the-clock $50 million command center had all the hubbub of an insurance office. There were no officials running around in commando attire. No shouted cries. No distress.</p>
        <p>''It's a pretty sedate atmosphere,'' said one staff member, who left midway through the night to ring in the new year at home. ''People are making phone calls and making reports, but there's not much occurring.''</p>
        <p>Officials at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported minor year 2000 computer problems at nuclear plants in New York, Arkansas, Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Minnesota. They said none of the problems had forced shutdowns or prompted safety concerns.</p>
        <p>The problems at two New York plants were typical. The New York Power Authority's Indian Point 3, about 30 miles north of New York City, and Nine Mile Point 1, near Oswego, both had problems receiving weather data. They were corrected, officials said.</p>
        <p>Other problems reported today included one with the security system at a field office for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that forced officials to post guards outside. Mr. Koskinen declined to identify the the office.</p>
        <p>Several electric utilities have reported errors on computer clocks, but they did not affect power plants.</p>
        <p>Windshear alert systems at six airports -- in Tampa, Denver, Atlanta, Orlando, Chicago O'Hare and St. Louis -- displayed an error message. The problem was fixed within two hours. Similar problems were reported at airports in Toledo, Ohio; Lansing, Mich.; Charleston, W.Va. and Moline, Ill.</p>
        <p>Airports in Rochester; Greensboro, N.C.; Memphis and Birmingham, Ala., displayed the date 1900 on their computers, but operations were not affected. The F.A.A. had fixed the problem at other airports and was reviewing why those airports were not corrected.</p>
        <p>Government officials warn that year 2000 problems may still crop up in the days ahead, when businesses open on Monday morning and the world's computers first begin operating in a year 2000 world.</p>
        <p>''It is far too early for us to feel totally satisfied and declare victory,'' Mr. Koskinen said at a briefing early this morning after the new year had begun in the Central time zone. ''I think we have three or four more days of careful, close monitoring before we can truly determine how successful we've been.''</p>
        <p>In addition, computer experts point out that problems could arise on Feb. 29, when computers have to deal with a leap year. On that date, Mr. Koskinen will be back in the command center -- dressed in a suit and tie, not camouflage -- ready for the worst.</p>
