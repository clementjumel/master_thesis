        <p>Basketball players added muscles and multimillion-dollar sneaker contracts. American yachts lost the America's Cup, gained it back, then lost it again. Grass all but disappeared on tennis courts. The natural stuff almost became extinct in baseball and football before injuries and nostalgia spurred its comeback. Lights finally shone at Wrigley Field. Europe became a major talent pool for the National Hockey League; golf and tennis benefited from America's diversity. What could happen next, on and off the field? A look at nine sports.</p>
        <p>Trying to claim its place as a sport for the masses, tennis decides to shift the focus away from power, by introducing heavier balls and slower synthetic surfaces that extend rallies, and by moving the baselines three feet farther away from the net.</p>

        <p>Trying to claim its place as a sport for the masses, tennis decides to shift the focus away from power, by introducing heavier balls and slower synthetic surfaces that extend rallies, and by moving the baselines three feet farther away from the net.</p>
        <p>Besides the new rules, the International Tennis Federation will change the Davis Cup format to a two-week, Olympic-style competition that will be played at major sports venues.</p>
        <p>Prize money for the Grand Slam tournaments will continue to escalate, with the United States Open offering the first $1 million purse to the men's and women's singles champions. As Wimbledon continues to resist equal prize money, the Women's Tennis Association will threaten to boycott Wimbledon.</p>
