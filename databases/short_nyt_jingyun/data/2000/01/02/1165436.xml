        <p>At the last VH1 Fashion Awards, Andy Dick did a comedy sketch posing as a caustic clothing designer wearing a Pokemon sleeping bag styled into a sleeved cape (above right). The outfit was worn to poke fun at designers like Donna Karan, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, who all promoted blanketlike outerwear this fall.</p>
        <p>I, too, laughed but then thought, ''Why not?'' Anything handcrafted is revered these days, and surely it would be better than donning my ''Drugstore Cowboy'' leather jacket for yet another winter. Besides, Martin Margiela's goose-down duvet ($1,200) would put a deep freeze on my bank account.</p>

        <p>I, too, laughed but then thought, ''Why not?'' Anything handcrafted is revered these days, and surely it would be better than donning my ''Drugstore Cowboy'' leather jacket for yet another winter. Besides, Martin Margiela's goose-down duvet ($1,200) would put a deep freeze on my bank account.</p>
        <p>I found my ''Star Wars'' children's indoor sleeping bag at Bradlees department store in Union Square, although Toys ''R'' Us stocks a fine variety as well ($30 and under) often featuring colorful graphics from movies like ''Tarzan'' or ''Toy Story.''</p>
        <p>An altruistic friend with a sewing machine helped me make my dream jacket, above left, but a neighborhood tailor can do the same for roughly one-tenth of the price designers command. Ramon Diaz, a tailor at 306 Mott Street, will cut armholes and add three Velcro straps to any polyester fiberfill cover for $90. The finished product skews toward Japanese club kid chic, but the coats are machine washable and, as the tag on one sleeping bag says, ''They're great for slumber parties, nap time and travel.''</p>
