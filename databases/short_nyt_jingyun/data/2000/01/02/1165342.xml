        <p>SHALLOT is short on aesthetics and long on flavor and value. This unpretentious four-month-old Thai and Japanese storefront restaurant at 735 Hawkins Avenue in Lake Ronkonkoma (631-981-0303) serves tasty, inexpensive, often exotic dishes. Unlike most of its Chinese-Japanese restaurant counterparts, Shallot, with its Thai-Japanese staff and owners, represents both cuisines equally well; there are no weak sisters or junior partners.</p>
        <p>At chow time, the satay and sushi, the tempura and Thai sticky rice are equally impressive. Nevertheless, I found myself tilting toward the Thai side of the menu. No doubt because there are far more opportunities on Long Island to sample Japanese fare. Thai food is often a blend of Indian and Chinese culinary ideas with touches of Burmese, Laotian, Western, Khmer, Indonesian and Malaysian influences. They are all changed, fitted and adapted into a distinctive, unified Thai cuisine.  That's true at Shallot with its familiar, yet different steamed vegetable dumplings and sweet and sour chicken, both Chinese menu mainstays as well as its Laksa beehoon, or rice noodles in red curry, a Malaysian preparation given a Thai spin. Likewise, the green-tea ice cream, often seen in Japanese restaurants, is listed on the Thai menu here.</p>

        <p>SHALLOT is short on aesthetics and long on flavor and value. This unpretentious four-month-old Thai and Japanese storefront restaurant at 735 Hawkins Avenue in Lake Ronkonkoma (631-981-0303) serves tasty, inexpensive, often exotic dishes. Unlike most of its Chinese-Japanese restaurant counterparts, Shallot, with its Thai-Japanese staff and owners, represents both cuisines equally well; there are no weak sisters or junior partners.</p>
        <p>At chow time, the satay and sushi, the tempura and Thai sticky rice are equally impressive. Nevertheless, I found myself tilting toward the Thai side of the menu. No doubt because there are far more opportunities on Long Island to sample Japanese fare. Thai food is often a blend of Indian and Chinese culinary ideas with touches of Burmese, Laotian, Western, Khmer, Indonesian and Malaysian influences. They are all changed, fitted and adapted into a distinctive, unified Thai cuisine.  That's true at Shallot with its familiar, yet different steamed vegetable dumplings and sweet and sour chicken, both Chinese menu mainstays as well as its Laksa beehoon, or rice noodles in red curry, a Malaysian preparation given a Thai spin. Likewise, the green-tea ice cream, often seen in Japanese restaurants, is listed on the Thai menu here.</p>
        <p>The vegetable dumplings ($4.95) with a scattering of fried onions are anything but the often bland, faintly flavored cylinders so prevalent on the Island. They come on a bed of cabbage with a snappy basil-garlic dipping sauce. The Thai-style sweet and sour chicken ($7.50), called can pre ya chicken, is a symphony of flavors: onions, peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and pineapples with the meat used more as a seasoning. As in many Thai dishes, the vegetables and fruits are the main event.</p>
        <p>As to the green-tea ice cream, if you like it elsewhere, you will here too. My own feeling is that green tea and ice cream go together about as well as caviar and marshmallows.  Desserts are best skipped here. A warm overripe banana buried and overwhelmed under a ton of sweet sticky rice ($3.95) wasn't very inspiring either.</p>
        <p>Although the end of the meal wasn't impressive, the beginning and middle were. Satay -- a generous portion of plump, juicy, skewered chicken cubes, escorted by spicy peanut and sweet vinegar sauces -- was exceptional (ask for its promised cucumber salad if it doesn't appear).  Even more interesting is Tom yum gung ($3.50), a lemony shrimp soup.  This basil-coriander-kissed lemon grass broth, with its lime juice, shrimp and straw mushrooms aplenty, gets a red chili hot and spicy menu designation, yet its sharp and pungent spices are moderated by citrus and mellow, aromatic leaves.  Two Japanese starters served as ideal drink accompaniments (Shallot is bring-your-own bottle country, making its modest cost still lower), while a third was a superior sushi rendition. Eda mame ($2.50), or soy beans cooked in slightly salty water, are as addictive as peanuts and better for you as well (take them out of their shells, just as you would peas).  Green seaweed ($3.95) might not sound inviting, but a clump of this delicate, zesty treat, served cold with crunchy cucumbers could well make the uninitiated into believers.</p>
        <p>The four pieces of sushi ($4.50), each with a different kind of fish fillet on flavored rice, accompanied by wasabi and fresh ginger, made me want to return for a more ambitious sample of the sushi bar's creations. The only Japanese entree sampled, shrimp and vegetable tempura ($10.95), was as good as it gets. Its price included the always pallid, mild miso soup and a sprightly house salad with a peanut-based dressing.  The shrimp and vegetables' almost ivory-colored breading was airy light and the quality and freshness of its ingredients was undeniable. Two robust, full flavored, generously proportioned entrees displayed the subtle and sophisticated allure of Shallot's uncompromisingly Thai menu.  Gun pao woosen ($10.95) is a soupy, stew-like seafood melange of shrimp, transparent cellophane noodles, bean sprouts, peppers, onions, tomatoes, shiitake mushrooms, carrot slivers and scallions in a delicious sea-tinged oyster sauce. Laksa beehoon ($6.95), an import from Malaysia, has become a Thai favorite. It's a rice noodle and red curry concoction with heaps of chicken, shrimp, tofu and bean sprouts. The curry broth packs a zingy, appealing taste kick.</p>
        <p>Shallot offers large portions and reasonable prices, rather than opulent surroundings or eye-catching presentations. Its dishes are pervaded with the delicate bouquet of lemon grass, cilantro and basil, the rich sweet flavor of coconut milk and the tart pucker-up punch of vinegar, lime and tamarind. And if all that isn't enough, a recent dinner for four of six appetizers, four entrees and two desserts cost $72.</p>
