        <p>For anyone who thinks New York City institutions never die, there is one word: vaudeville. Vaudeville bombed  with the advent of radio and television, proving that even dancing girls and the old soft shoe can't save an institution whose time has passed.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it is only in the last 100 years that the city got the New York Public Library, the Ford Foundation, the Guggenheim and the subway.</p>
        <p>Institutions come and go in New York, a city long emblematic of humanity's perpetual reinvention. It stands to reason: as social needs and aspirations change, so do the public and private entities set up to handle them.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, a range of influential New Yorkers were asked about the institutions that ought to be established in the 21st century.</p>
