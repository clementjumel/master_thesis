        <p>FRANCE: MORE EXPLOSIVES LINKED TO BASQUES  The French police have seized a ton of explosives they said belonged to the Spanish Basque separatist guerrilla group E.T.A., a week after two powerful van bombs were found and defused in Spain. The explosives were found in an unused garage outside the city of Pau near the Spanish border.</p>

        <p>SUDAN: CABINET QUITS  Three weeks after declaring a state of emergency, President Omar el-Bashir said he had accepted his cabinet's resignation, paving the way for him to consolidate his power. In a speech marking Sudan's 44th anniversary of independence, Mr. Bashir said ministers and state governors had expressed their desire to resign and he had accepted their resignations. However, he asked them to stay on as caretakers until he could reform the cabinet.</p>

        <p>EAST TIMOR: U.N. AIDE APOLOGIZES  The United Nations administrator in East Timor apologized for its failure to predict and prevent a wave of violence after the territory's overwhelming vote for independence from Indonesia. Sergio Vieira de Mello, who is overseeing East Timor's transition to independence, made the apology during a visit to the coffee-growing area of Ermera, said the United Nations spokesman Fred Eckhard.</p>

        <p>EAST TIMOR: GUSMAO RULES HIMSELF OUT  Jose Alexandre Gusmao said he foresaw full independence for East Timor in at most two years but that he did not plan to become its first president. Mr. Gusmao had been widely expected to become an independent East Timor's first leader, but said he intended to signal that leaders of the independence struggle did not have an automatic right to power.</p>

        <p>HONDURAS, NICARAGUA: MILITARY PACT  Honduras and Nicaragua have agreed to freeze ground troop deployments and withdraw naval forces from the Caribbean Sea to avert military conflict pending resolution of a border dispute, an official with the Organization of American States said. Relations soured in November when the Honduran Congress ratified an accord that claimed for Honduras and Colombia 52,000 square miles of Caribbean coastal waters, parts of which are also claimed by Nicaragua.</p>

        <p>PARAGUAY: CABINET MINISTER QUITS  Agriculture Minister Oscar Denis quit after his Liberal Party voted to abandon the coalition government of President Luis Gonzalez Macchi.

        <p>COLOMBIA: LEADER VETOES GENOCIDE BILL  In an unex-pected reversal, President Andres Pastrana vetoed a bill that would have made genocide and forced disappearance criminal acts. His administration shifted course after the armed forces complained that such a law would leave soldiers open to prosecution, in civilian rather than military courts, for deaths inflicted in combat with leftist guerrillas.</p>

        <p>IRAN: CALL TO DESTROY ISRAEL  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, called for the destruction of Israel, saying it was the only way to solve the Middle East's problems.

        <p>LEBANON: HEZBOLLAH'S VOW  The Hezbollah movement said it intended to keep up its attacks on Israeli troops in south Lebanon, a day after a suicide bombing narrowly missed an Israeli patrol near the village of Qlaia, wounding 12 Lebanese civilians and an Israeli soldier. ''Hezbollah operations will not stop before or after the negotiations'' between Israel and Syria, a Hezbollah press official said.</p>
