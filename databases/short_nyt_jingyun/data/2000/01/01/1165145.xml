        <p>In a rainbow blizzard of confetti and a symphony of neon and fireworks, a mighty crush of New Year's merrymakers welcomed the year 2000 in Times Square, the world's most famous intersection.</p>
        <p>Undeterred by fears of terrorism or Y2K havoc, the Times Square crowd showed every sign of being the biggest and noisiest ever, bent on watching history happen, watching themselves on huge video screens and hoping that friends and relatives were watching them on television at home.</p>
        <p>After the ball atop 1 Times Square dropped at midnight, a jubilant Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani admitted that he had been nervous about the threat of terrorism or Y2K upheaval ''right until the last minute.'' But the day's festivities had gone without a hitch.</p>
        <p>''I am so proud of all the people of New York City,'' he said. ''I am so proud of the most diverse city in the world. We can have a great celebration and we can do it peacefully and decently.''</p>
        <p>As the revelers whooped and hollered, hugged and kissed, one couple made the ultimate hopeful statement about the new millennium. At the stroke of midnight, Alex Buxton asked Sicely Schiffgen to marry him, with what looked like a four-carat diamond and platinum ring.</p>
        <p>The most die-hard of revelers arrived a day ahead of schedule, camping out on a chill, rainy night in  cardboard huts in order to claim prime viewing spots for the party to end all parties.</p>
        <p>They won the bragging rights for being in Times Square at 7 in the morning, when 2000 arrived in the islands of the South Pacific, 17 time zones away. At that moment, as sanitation workers tried to haul away remains of the soggy campsites, the 83,000-watt Waterford crystal ball was hoisted to the top of its tower to the strains of Copland's ''Fanfare for the Common Man.''</p>
        <p>Tamar Stratyevskaya, 23, could have used a hot shower right about then. She had spent the night, with only a quilt to warm her, in the makeshift village of cardboard lean-tos, just the sort of encampment mayors from coast to coast have been trying to dismantle.</p>
        <p>''Everyone I know thought I was crazy,'' said Ms. Stratyevskaya, a resident of Washington Heights. ''But actually, it's kind of fun.''</p>
        <p>Other less compulsive revelers came in waves throughout the day: families who wanted a taste of the excitement before nightfall; immigrants eager to ring in the New Year twice, once along with their homeland and once in their new home; and tourists and New Yorkers alike who wedged themselves into spectator pens to await the midnight saturnalia.</p>
        <p>As always, the college crowd, doing a cold-weather imitation of spring break in Fort Lauderdale, grew wild and crazy -- or wilder and crazier -- as the witching hour approached. Mugging for the television cameras, throwing each other in the air as if in a mosh pit, smelling suspiciously like contraband alcohol and marijuana, they tirelessly welcomed another year of hijinks.</p>
        <p>Kamran Syed, a 19-year-old student at the University of Southern California film school, had flown from Los Angeles by himself to see the ball drop. ''Hoo wah!,'' he shouted, noting that he had just downed three Bombay Sapphire martinis and had been awake for 31 hours. I'm</p>
        <p>Carlos Reina, another solo traveler, who drove all the way from northern Mexico, also had had too much to drink, too little to eat and not enough sleep. ''I hope I die here,'' he said, swilling beer. 'I'm so happy.''</p>
        <p>But not all the party animals were men. Three United Airlines stewardesses were as close to the ball as a spectator could get, near the Armed Forces recruiting station on the narrow traffic island at 43rd Street separating Seventh Avenue and Broadway.</p>
        <p>''I'm cute, that's all you need to know,'' said Nancy Lewis, 25, of San Diego.''I flirted my way past the police. That's how I got here.''</p>
        <p>In years past, the rowdy countdown to midnight was the soul of the Times Square celebration. But for the year 2000 celebration, led by the Times Square Business Improvement District, and consonant with the transformation of this once-squalid triangle, a family-friendly daylong celebration was planned.</p>
        <p>Two years in the making, with all the special effects of a Disney movie and the bravura of a Broadway play, Times Square 2000, as it was called, was an hour-by-hour, time zone-by-time zone evocation of the cultures of each region of the world.</p>
        <p>That made it possible for people who would never venture to Times Square on New Year's Eve to sample the historic party.</p>
        <p>Erin Rogers and Troy Blakely, sweethearts living in New York for less than a year, ventured forth from their East Side apartment shortly before noon, the New Year in Indonesia. ''We came to see it before it got crazy,'' said Ms. Rogers, a special education teacher. '' Someday we can tell people we were there at 12.''</p>
        <p>Another New Yorker with a simple game plan was Diane Keller, a social worker. She would stay long enough to shoot one roll of film, she said, and then head for the sales at Lord &amp; Taylor.</p>
        <p>Rosalia Aragon, with her 10-year-old son and several colleagues from work, did Times Square in under two hours, watching the New Year arrive in Southeast Asia. Then they all took the train back to New Jersey for quiet celebrations at home.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Aragon would have liked to have seen her home country Mexico usher in the New Year, but that would not come until after midnight. Kazutaka Noma and his family were luckier -- they were able to celebrate at 10 a.m., under a hail of pink confetti, meant to resemble cherry blossoms, just as his parents were popping Champagne in Japan.</p>
        <p>Tourists, as usual, seemed to dominate the crowd, like . the Thompsett family from Kentucky, who were saving money by staying in a Holiday Inn in Poughkeepsie. They reached Times Square at mid-afternoon, when spectator pens were already full up to 47th Street. There, they claimed a spot, which they dared not abandon, with a decent view and a barricade to lean on when they got tired.</p>
        <p>''I told them it's going to be long and boring,'' said John Thompsett, an Army recruiter, as his children, Aaron, 13, and Lillian, 15, rolled their eyes. ''I'm trying to get them educated in once-in-a-lifetime things.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Janet Mouradian, a surgical pathologist at Cornell Medical Center and an unlikely denizen of Times Square on this particular night, kept herself busy editing an Armenian play, written by her New Year's companion, Herand Markarian.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mouradian, an Armenian immigrant, had braved this scene once before, in 1964, her first year in America.''I do what I enjoy in life and there's only one millennium,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Looking down on the square at intervals through the day and evening was Peter Jennings, the anchorman for ABC-TV's 24-hour broadcast. He would stand pressed to the bulletproof windows of the studio, staring at the mobs below. They, in turn, would wave to him, seeking the perfect position in front of an ABC camera so they could simultaneously wave to the folks back home.</p>
        <p>The pantomime was a perfect metaphor. New Year's Eve here, despite the extravagant performance -- dancers, puppets, souvenirs, sound-and-light shows -- is all about seeing and being seen. Thus the run on camcorders and disposable cameras at the electronics stores along Broadway. And the posters (Mom, We Made It Fine, Trust Jesus, Sammy Loves Christine) raised high to any camera nearby.</p>
        <p>Many people came prepared with supplies to keep them comfortable, occupied and fed: beach chairs and blankets, chess sets and mystery novels, and munchies of all kinds. One family turned a carton upside down to make an ad hoc picnic table, then unpacked a loaf of bread, jars of peanut butter and jelly and a half gallon of milk.</p>
        <p>The crowd for the most part was jolly. But not Shelley Brown, from Maryland, who sat sniffling and hacking in a lawn chair, wrapped head to toe in scarves and blankets. At her feet was an overnight bag, stuffed with tissues and cough syrup.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Brown had come down with the flu at the most inopportune of times. But she didn't want to disappoint her husband, Ryan. ''I've been talking about this for the last seven years,'' he said. ''I grew up watching Dick Clark on television and thought it would be so cool. We had to be here.''</p>
