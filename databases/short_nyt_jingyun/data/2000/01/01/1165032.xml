        <p>Still regarded by die-hard nostalgists as the greatest Hollywood film ever made, ''Gone With the Wind'' has been looking awfully musty lately, and, as time goes by, its blushing, romantic vision of the Confederacy, the Civil War, the burning of Atlanta and the freeing of the slaves can only look increasingly quaint.

        <p>Still regarded by die-hard nostalgists as the greatest Hollywood film ever made, ''Gone With the Wind'' has been looking awfully musty lately, and, as time goes by, its blushing, romantic vision of the Confederacy, the Civil War, the burning of Atlanta and the freeing of the slaves can only look increasingly quaint. The movie's black characters, while sympathetically drawn, are crude racial stereotypes, and its portrayal of the Confederacy as a lost paradise of dashing cavaliers yakking about honor and cinched-waisted Southern belles swooning on their pedestals is almost embarrassingly sentimental.</p>
        <p>The movie's strengths remain its narrative sweep and Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable's portrayals of two sexy, ruthless narcissists zestfully torturing each other. These deft, knowing performances are the most modern aspects of a movie that 100 years from now will be regarded as a period piece -- a guilty pleasure to be consumed not for its historical or artistic value, but as an extra-sudsy bubble bath infused with the scent of Georgia pine.</p>
