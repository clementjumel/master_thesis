        <p>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist surveyed the state of the federal judiciary today and, in contrast to many of his 13 previous year-end reports, pronounced himself quite pleased.</p>
        <p>The chief justice noted progress in three areas he had identified as problems in his report a year ago. At that time, all seven seats on the United States Sentencing Commission were vacant because of a political impasse between the White House and Congress. Now, the seats have been filled as a result of a compromise.</p>
        <p>Last year, Congress had provided neither a raise nor a cost-of-living adjustment for federal judges. This fall, Congress approved a 3.4 percent cost-of-living adjustment, taking effect on Jan. 1, that will bring the annual salaries of federal district judges to $141,300; of judges on the courts of appeals to $149,900; of Supreme Court associate justices to $173,600; and of the chief justice to $181,400.</p>
        <p>The judiciary was ''appreciative,'' Chief Justice Rehnquist said today, ''but it should not be confused with a raise in salary.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''We must continue to work for more appropriate compensation for federal judges to maintain the quality and morale of the federal judiciary.''</p>
        <p>The third subject on which the chief justice noted progress was the caseload of the federal courts, which grew only modestly after sharp increases. Criminal cases in the federal district courts, for example were up by 4 percent to 59,923, compared with 15 percent in 1998.</p>
        <p>As he has often done, the chief justice criticized what he called the ''unnecessary federalization of traditional state law matters,'' which he said placed increased burdens on the federal courts. But he said he was pleased by increased attention to this issue during the past year as a result of hearings in the Government Affairs Committee of the Senate and a report by an American Bar Association task force.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Rehnquist asked Congress to appropriate money for higher pay for lawyers who are appointed to represent indigent defendants in federal criminal cases. While the authorized rate is $75 an hour for time the lawyers spend in court, inadequate funding has meant that in most judicial districts, the lawyers are actually paid only $65. That is not enough to cover overhead, the chief justice said, adding, ''Adequate pay for appointed counsel is important to ensure that a defendant's constitutional right to counsel is fulfilled.''</p>
