        <p>The centruy's turn has been a time of retrospectives: what was the most important event, who was the most influential thinker? Arts &amp; Ideas decided to take a look ahead at what some of today's researchers are working on. From the most raked-over field, like the history of the ancient world, to the latest medical technology, scholars are coming up with fresh insights. Some ideas may turn into breakthroughs, and others may turn out to be dead-ends, but the journey is rarely boring. Here is a handful of works in progress.</p>
        <p>What idea gave birth to the American character? What made the United States so distinctive a nation? And how did it attain its imposing status?</p>
        <p>One answer has been offered above all others. The United States was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. This is what Alexis de Tocqueville saw as the defining principle of American life. Democracy and egalitarianism shaped our culture, determined our character and influenced our politics.</p>
        <p>But James E. Block, in a project that began as a doctoral dissertation for the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago, offers another answer. The primary concept that shaped America is not liberty, it is ''agency.''</p>
        <p>This might seem a bit peculiar. This use of the word agency seems antique and hardly familiar. In Mr. Block's interpretation, agency is a notion that developed in 16th-century England, in a Puritan challenge to the monarchical order. Agency required a new view of human nature and a new interpretation of responsibility: the individual becomes a self-reliant agent able to act freely, but in that freedom a choice is made to serve a larger vision. Agency is not servitude; it is a path freely chosen. And agency is not freedom; it defers to a collective authority.</p>
        <p>An agent might be a congregant who joins an independent church and becomes devoted to its mission. Or an agent might be a politician in a constitutional government whose demands are tempered by the social contract. An agent, in Mr. Block's telling, is the archetypally American character.</p>
        <p>In a densely packed dissertation tracing the origins of the idea in the tracts, diaries and sermons of dissenting Puritan ministers in the 1570's, Mr. Block follows its evolution in the works of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke until it comes into its own in Colonial America. In fact, Mr. Block suggests, the American Revolution cannot be fully understood as a fight for independence and liberty. Those were terms used to persuade the agrarian populace to join forces with the political elite in service to a common good. Instead of enshrining liberty, the Revolution enshrined agency.</p>
        <p>This is why, Mr. Block argues, American history has always involved a tension between individual freedom and collective demands. From the start, untethered liberty was seen as a danger; it was indulgent and potentially disruptive. But servitude to an unquestioned authority was just as troubling. So iconoclasm and conformity continually clash; the compromise is a notion of agency where freedom freely serves a common cause.</p>
        <p>In proposing a new paradigm, Mr. Block is not the typical brash young scholar. He is 53, has practiced law and teaches political science at DePaul University in Chicago. But his doctoral adviser, Martin E. Marty, a professor emeritus of the University of Chicago, calls his work a ''tour de force'' that confronts us with ''a radical rethinking of American traditions.'' ''Get used to the word agency alongside liberty when reckoning with American life,'' he said. Mr. Block's interpretation also raises questions about contemporary political culture, in which the very existence of common goals is challenged. At the moment it is being identified, then, is agency about to end?</p>
