        <p>Akihiro Takahashi had noticed the American bombers flying high in the bright sky overhead. Then came the terrible blast. For this 68-year-old former director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, the clouds from the bombing still hover starkly over Japan, even if recent polls show that the 1995 Kobe earthquake is cited by more people as the century's most significant event.</p>

        <p>Akihiro Takahashi had noticed the American bombers flying high in the bright sky overhead. Then came the terrible blast. For this 68-year-old former director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, the clouds from the bombing still hover starkly over Japan, even if recent polls show that the 1995 Kobe earthquake is cited by more people as the century's most significant event.</p>
        <p>Far more than most people her age, Ayako Matsushima, 18, worries about the future, when Japan's population will be in decline and the aged will outnumber the young. Still, Miss Matsushima, a high school senior in Hiroshima, sees a bright side.</p>
        <p>HOWARD W. FRENCH</p>
        <p>AKIHIRO TAKAHASHI</p>
        <p>That moment, there was an awful roaring sound, and suddenly the whole area turned very dark, as dark as if it were nighttime. I had no idea what had happened. After a while, when the smog began to clear and the wind died down, the light began to return. I realized that I had been thrown at least 10 yards. I found myself on the ground, face down. Our class had about 60 students and there were about 150 students in the schoolyard. Everybody was thrown away. Everything was flattened.</p>
        <p>I worry that memories of the A-bomb attack are fading. Of course, the shock of the earthquake is still recent, and I feel sorry for the victims. But remember, with one bomb, a whole central city perished.</p>
        <p>AYAKO MATSUSHIMA</p>
        <p>The most important element for the future is human resources. But looking at the decline of academic standards, and young people's fashions and the changes in the language, I wonder if we will have enough qualified people to compete.</p>
        <p>Change is not only happening in a bad direction. Certainly in the area of sex discrimination things are steadily improving in Japan. Women are able to blossom much more than in the old society, and young people are benefiting from changes in the way people are evaluated at work. People are being judged on their ability more and more now instead of relying on the seniority system.</p>
