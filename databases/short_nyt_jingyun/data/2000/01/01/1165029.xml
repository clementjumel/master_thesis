        <p>The challenge put to The Times's critics was direct: Name a 20th-century work considered ''timeless'' today that you think will be all but forgotten in 100 years. Their selections:</p>
        <p>PICASSO, A BIT TOO VIRTUOUS</p>
        <p>When Picasso was commissioned to paint for the Spanish Republican Pavilion at the World's Fair in Paris in 1937, he came up with the idea of a big, abstract picture about the recent bombing of a Basque town he had never visited.</p>
        <p>''Guernica'' became the 20th century's most famous painting because Picasso was the century's most famous artist and because, having been intended for Republican Spain, the picture spent several decades, with Picasso's approval, in conspicuous and splendid exile at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. There it became an international symbol of antifascism until Generalissimo Francisco Franco died.</p>
        <p>With the personality cult of Picasso having already begun to fade along with memories of the general, ''Guernica'' can increasingly be seen as a virtuous hodgepodge of Cubist design enlarged to the scale of a billboard and hitched to a program of political dissent that Picasso seemed never to have been very comfortable with. In the end, he was comfortable in his art only with himself as the subject.</p>
