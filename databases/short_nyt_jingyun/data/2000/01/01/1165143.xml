        <p>The title of first American baby of the millennium had not been officially decided shortly after midnight today, but locally, a brand new Queens native is making her bid.</p>
        <p>The girl, 7 pounds 8 ounces, was born two seconds after midnight at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, said Dario Centorcelli, a hospital spokesman. He did not know the girl's name.</p>
        <p>In Hartford, Miesha Latoya Walker, 7 pounds 13 ounces, was born at Hartford Hospital just 30 seconds into the year, The Associated Press reported. Her mother is Yvette Walker, 34, of Hartford.</p>
        <p>Dr. Catie Campbell told the A.P. the mother was ready to deliver before midnight, but decided to wait until the new year had arrived.</p>
        <p>The President's Council on Y2K Conversion, however, announced yesterday that the first baby born on American soil in the Year 2000 was born in Guam, on the far side of the international dateline. The baby, a boy, weighed 7.7 pounds, the A.P. reported.</p>
        <p>The first baby and family stand to collect countless prizes, including, among other things, a Texas college education, provided by the Houston radio station KHMX.</p>
