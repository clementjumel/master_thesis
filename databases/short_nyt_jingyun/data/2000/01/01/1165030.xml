        <p>'BITCHES BREW,' CHIC AND PERISHABLE</p>
        <p>In 1969, there was no way that Miles Davis's ''Bitches Brew'' would not have been seen as pivotal. Jazz and rock, and their respective audiences, were bending toward each other, and this double album had strange instrumentation and six extremely long tracks; its psychedelic cover illustrations were done by Mati Klarwein, the artist Santana had hired.</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly, some of it remains beautiful. But it is bland compared with Davis's destination in electric music a few years later. A great deal of ''Bitches Brew'' was chic and perishable: its long, dull stretches of funk, electric piano and spidery bass-clarinet now seem as innocuous as incidental music for a film. Reissued last year in a four-CD boxed set, with alternate takes, it has assumed masterpiece status again, though some of the best music from Davis's early 70's period has never been available on CD in this country.</p>
