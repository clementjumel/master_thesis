        <p>''Einstein on the Beach,'' with music by Philip Glass and stage pictures by Robert Wilson, is a fragile beauty that may not survive its time.

        <p>The challenge put to The Times's critics was direct: Name a 20th-century work considered ''timeless'' today that you think will be all but forgotten in 100 years. Their selections:</p>
        <p>'EINSTEIN' ON THE SHOALS</p>
        <p>''Einstein on the Beach,'' with music by Philip Glass and stage pictures by Robert Wilson, is a fragile beauty that may not survive its time. The music and production are so co-dependent that Mr. Wilson's successors (or even an older Robert Wilson) will be hard pressed to re-establish the original chemistries.</p>
        <p>There is also the nature of the music, which is as much a rejection of the culture around it as something in itself. ''Einstein'' is not about symphonic string sections, expressive phrases or the artist as hero. It is proudly loud and defiantly mechanical; it replaces beginning, middle and end with music that suddenly starts and arbitrarily stops.</p>
        <p>Rebellion needs an enemy, and there is a good chance that the influence of 19th-century Romanticism won't linger another 100 years. Having nothing left to push against, ''Einstein'' may lose its reason for being.</p>
