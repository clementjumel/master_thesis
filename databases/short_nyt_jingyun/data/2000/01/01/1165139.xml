        <p>Despite a few sputters and glitches, the world's computers appear to have survived the year 2000 rollover without major problems -- and with humanity's faith in technology intact, at least for another day.</p>
        <p>As clocks passed midnight around the world, there were a flurry of reports of apparently minor problems: a timing device at a electric plant in Wisconsin jumped ahead 35 days, but it was quickly reset; a monitoring system at a Japanese nuclear plant malfunctioned, but it did not affect the operation of the reactor; in Australia, ticketing machines on some buses jammed.</p>
        <p>The technology failures with greater impact were a result of crowding -- circuits jammed when too many people tried to make cellular phone calls in Japan, New Zealand and elsewhere -- instead of computer software that could not fathom the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Yet the day arrived without the kind of catastrophic problems once feared, of widespread power failures or planes crashing. The computers of the United States power grid and air-traffic control system rolled over to the New Year just past 7 p.m. Eastern time, which is midnight Greenwich Mean Time, and things went without a hitch.</p>
        <p>''I've never felt there was any significant chance the United States would have any problem in its infrastructure,'' said John A. Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. But he cautioned against complacency in the United States and around the world. ''There are likely to be some glitches along the way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The real test, experts say, will come in the days and weeks ahead as people return to work, as factories, offices and stores begin normal operations. ''To look at midnight as the main event would be a mistake,'' said David Cassano, general manager of I.B.M.'s year 2000 program. ''We'll really start to find out where we stand in the first weeks of January as businesses run their systems for the time.''</p>
        <p>Still, expectations about the severity of the year 2000 problem have been scaled back sharply in recent months. The prospect of computer failures cascading destructively across the world economy was taken as a serious threat not long ago. But most analysts now regard such warnings as exaggerated.</p>
        <p>Instead, computer specialists are now watching mainly for a rash of small, but fixable, glitches in computer programs related to the year 2000 problem. These problems, most analysts say, should amount to an economic headache, not a serious illness -- though there are a few analysts who say that a recession early this year is still possible.</p>
        <p>Yet around the world, fears about Y2K, as the computer problem is known, were the exception. As he withdrew a few hundred dollars from an automated teller machine in Rome yesterday, Federico Pacifici, 44, said: ''I have faith in technology. I don't think normal people will have any problem.''</p>
        <p>In Japan, the reaction was not quite so relaxed, but there was no evidence of year 2000 panic. Strolling through Tokyo's Ginza district last night, Masao Ito, 66, observed, ''I was a bit worried about Y2K, but I didn't think it would be a lasting problem, so I wasn't terribly concerned.''</p>
        <p>Japanese are accustomed to stockpiling basic goods as a precaution against earthquakes, and the government had recommended that citizens have extra goods on hand in case of year 2000 breakdowns. Masato Takahashi, a student, said he had put away enough water and food for a week. ''I'm not expecting anything major, he said. ''I just thought there might be some problem.''</p>
        <p>The isolated cases of panicky reactions may have had little to do with technology. In rural Thailand, for example, the government said farmers and villagers had been withdrawing cash from banks and clearing out food markets because of year 2000 fears. ''It doesn't make sense,'' said Kitti Patpongpaibul, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand. ''Almost none of these people own credit cards or computers.''</p>
        <p>Astrologers in the Thai countryside have apparently been spreading dire year 2000 predictions.</p>
        <p>Globally, the more common sentiment seemed to be that of Spaniards. Surveys have found Spaniards largely unconcerned by the computer problem, known as ''Effecto 2000'' in Spain, and 90 percent said they had made no special preparations. ''There's been no panic buying,'' said Carlos Lizana, the manager of a Supersol supermarket in Madrid.</p>
        <p>If the economic fallout is minimal,  it will be largely because many governments and corporations eventually listened to the dire warnings of year 2000 readiness advocates. And they invested more than $250 billion worldwide in finding and fixing the problem.</p>
        <p>The United States government alone spent $8.4 billion to fix the glitches in the computers that handle everything from sending out Social Security checks to tracking airplanes with the Federal Aviation Administration's air-traffic control system. The government's efforts accelerated sharply after Mr. Koskinen became the head of the administration's year 2000 program in February 1998.</p>
        <p>Companies may have been slow to start -- an estimated 90 percent of corporate fix-it spending has occurred since 1997 -- but once they began, they invested heavily to tackle their year 2000 problems. Citigroup, for example, spent roughly $950 million to get its banks, securities trading desks and insurance operations ready for the Year 2000 rollover.</p>
        <p>''There have been massive investments made to address the Y2K issue and those investments will mean that the most severe problems should be avoided,'' said Lou Marcoccio, the year 2000 research director for the Gartner Group, a computer consulting and market research firm.</p>
        <p>The year 2000 problem has proved so costly to try to fix because it has been a painstaking task for thousands of people worldwide, searching through billions of lines of programming code, much of it decades old. The problem dates back to the 1960's and before. Back then, storage space on disks was scarce and costly, so programmers routinely omitted the first two digits in year dates. The danger is that computers will fail to interpret the ''00'' date as 2000, and shut off or malfunction.</p>
        <p>Around the world, the year 2000 rollover has meant that much of the computer industry is on around-the-clock duty, watching for problems and ready to fix ones that do crop up. It has been a quiet watch so far.</p>
        <p>From her desk in Hewlett-Packard's year 2000 center in Palo Alto, Calif., Kathy Hahn filed her first status report at 3:45 a.m. Like all the reports she has filed since, it was a green light: the company's field office in Auckland, New Zealand, reported that there were no apparent problems plaguing the company's computer systems at night.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Hahn, director of Hewlett-Packard's year 2000 planning, yesterday's lack of problems were a rewarding finish to nearly three years of hard work in preparation. ''It feels like I've been pregnant for two and a half years,'' she said. ''I'm feeling a great sense of relief.''</p>
        <p>Edward Yardeni, a leading Wall Street economist, said it was much too early to relax about the year 2000 problem. Yet even he is revising his earlier dark warnings.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1997, Mr. Yardeni warned that the computer problem could be the catalyst for a recession as severe as the 1974-75 downturn in the aftermath of the first oil shock. But he has done some rethinking recently. ''It's certainly not going to be as bad as I thought it would be,'' said Mr. Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yardeni still thinks it is likely there will be a recession in the first half of 2000 but says it will be a brief, shallow economic dip.</p>
        <p>Other analysts do not go that far, but they caution against being too encouraged by the first-day reports. ''The real test is coming in the days and weeks ahead, and I think there is a good chance the world's going to have a digital hangover for the three to six months,'' said Gary Beach, publisher of CIO Magazine, who has testified before Congress on the year 2000 issue.</p>
