        <p>The last skyscraper added to the New York skyline during the 20th century, 4 Times Square, was built to last 100 years or more. But the city that surrounds the 48-story office tower is not so up to date.</p>
        <p>Below the streets lie 3,000 miles of brittle, cast iron water mains and tens of thousands of miles of copper wire unable to carry the mega bytes of information that urban dwellers are beginning to demand.</p>
        <p>The streets themselves are ill-suited to today's needs. Within 20 years, transportation analysts say, bridges, tunnels subways, commter trains and airports will be clogged beyond capacity.</p>
        <p>Will physical Manhattan be able to sustain New York as the world's leading city in the new century? From a perch in 4 Times Square, here is a look at some key considerations.</p>
