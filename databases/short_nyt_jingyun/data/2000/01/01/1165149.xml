        <p>It was late afternoon in Hoboken, N.J. He was wearing a plastic, cobalt-colored top hat advertising ''Millennium 2000.'' She was donning a pair of plastic, glow-in-the-dark glasses proclaiming ''2000.'' And together, Jeff and Stacy Vitale looked like they were primed for a party for the ages tonight.</p>
        <p>Their destination? Not Times Square, since they had worked all day in Midtown Manhattan, buying the millennial gear along the way.</p>
        <p>Instead, they were heading to one of the most crowded spots tonight in this hip city: Blockbuster Video.</p>
        <p>''I want to rent 'Mickey Blue Eyes,'' said Mrs. Vitale, a 30-year-old accountant.</p>
        <p>The Vitales were far from lone wolves. Throughout Hoboken a surprisingly large number of people said that they would celebrate what was supposed to be the grandest New Year's Eve of all time in regular, couch-potato fashion.</p>
        <p>All day and into the early evening hours, people were behaving as if this night were no different than any other weekend night: picking up groceries, grabbing some beer and wine, ordering take-out food.</p>
        <p>Some people said that they were making a statement, of sorts, by refusing to fall for what has been a nonstop blitz of hype.</p>
        <p>And some people, like Cybele Emanuelle, a 28-year-old Web designer, had to work or be on call. So Ms. Emanuelle said it was no big deal that her evening's agenda included ''The Blair Witch Project.''</p>
        <p>''It's a Blockbuster night,'' shrugged Ms. Emanuelle, who was eying a bottle of Champagne at Sparrow Wine &amp; Liquor on Washington Street. But Saturday, she added, will be a different story: she'll be going to a party.</p>
