        <p>Lily Yen, born to a merchant family in Shanghai, was one of very few women in China able to attend a university in the early part of the 20th century. She volunteered to teach schoolgirls in a poor, inland rural province. War and recurrent political campaigns intruded, and Mrs. Yen's family was divided when half her relatives moved to Taiwan in 1949. Now 96 and a retired homemaker, she thinks today's young people are too self-centered and have lost the spirit of sacrifice.</p>
        <p>Grace Shen, a 21-year-old student of international finance at Fudan University, in Shanghai, thinks women of previous generations lost their individuality in their subservience to men. She is proud to be independent.</p>
        <p>SETH FAISON</p>
        <p>LILY YEN</p>
        <p>Seventy-five years ago, I went to work as a teacher in a very poor area in inland China where some missionaries were trying to set up a school for girls. At the time, farming families wanted only boys. When girls were born, they were often dumped in the road. It was a desperately poor area. There was little edible food. It was really rough. But I loved it. We were giving so much, I didn't think about myself at all. The area was shifting from control of one warlord to another, and it was very hard to move anywhere. The simplest things took on great meaning. To be able to teach young girls to read and write, it gave them a chance in life.</p>
        <p>Later the Japanese came, and then there was civil war. You never knew what was going to come next. But I was always optimistic. I did not work after I got married. I had three children. I always helped my husband, and looked after my children. It was not a complicated life. It was a good life. In Shanghai, we lived in a comfortable house. During the famine [1958 to 1961] it was not so good. We had money, but there was nothing to buy. In the mid-60's, life was good again. During the Cultural Revolution everything got turned upside down. They took our house and 10 families moved in. I moved to a tiny place under the stairway of an old house. But it had a little kerosene stove. I liked it. I told everyone, it's warm in the winter and there are no bugs in the summer. Some of them could not believe that I stayed upbeat even in such a terrible time. But it was a terrible time. People stopped going to school. We lost a whole generation.</p>
        <p>That has had an effect on following generations, too. Look at kids today. They don't know what it means to be civilized. They are very materialistic. Look at the people who have become rich. Young people don't listen. If they were willing to listen, I would tell them that the most important thing in life is to be generous with others, that is what makes life meaningful. But I don't see that in China today.</p>
        <p>GRACE SHEN</p>
        <p>When I was a little girl, I figured out that I would be graduating from college in 2000. I decided that was when I would really start my life. I knew I would want to support myself and to be independent in that year. A lot of girls spend their time worrying about their clothes and how they look, but I feel like I want to look forward, to plan for the future. I am studying international finance because I want to work in the global arena.</p>
        <p>To be a full person, I need to be independent. When people are economically independent, they change in many ways. Then it is hard to imagine going back and relying on someone else. In the new century women don't have to rely on a man anymore.</p>
        <p>My mother was a teacher and then a saleswoman. But she made her career decisions based on what was best for our family. I want to travel all over the world. I want to study in the United States. China is becoming more and more open. A generation ago, very few people were allowed to go overseas. Now it's very common.</p>
        <p>My generation is different. Older people say we are selfish. I say we are just more concerned with our personal development. We have many many more choices; why not take advantage of that?</p>
        <p>My generation pays a lot more attention to the world at large. All my friends are on the Internet every day. To me, ''www'' is like Ali Baba saying ''Open sesame.''</p>
        <p>The last century was continuous revolution -- the fall of the Qing dynasty, the warlord period, all the way to the Cultural Revolution. The past 20 years are almost like a revolution, too, in how everything has changed. But it is a very different kind of revolution. Because the ground is stable. When life outside is stable, you can begin to concentrate on yourself, on improving yourself.</p>
