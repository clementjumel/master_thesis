        <p>''A Chorus Line'' was the show everyone wanted to cuddle with. This big-hearted, collaborative musical, overseen by the great choreographer Michael Bennett, seemed to reflect the solipsism of the 1970's, as it transformed a dance audition into group therapy.

        <p>Listen with cold ears to a cast recording today, however, and you may wonder why you fell so hard. The show felt like one big hugfest during its run. But it fed off the specific sentimentality of its time as much as ''South Pacific'' did, and without anything like Richard Rodgers's lush score. All those songs about growing up lonely and rejected, set to Marvin Hamlisch's jinglelike melodies, now bring to mind lines from a tougher musical of the period, ''Chicago'': ''None of us ever got enough love in our childhood. That's show biz, kid.''</p>
