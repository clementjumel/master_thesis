        <p>At the last minute, Hungary's millennium planners turned into the Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time Players.</p>
        <p>Two unusual events had been set for midnight: the first spin of a giant Wheel of Time holding an hourglass containing seven tons of customized sand, and a special session of Parliament to celebrate 1,000 years of Hungarian statehood.</p>
        <p>Money and technical problems delayed the wheel -- it will ring in 2001.</p>
        <p>Political wrangling put the parliamentary session off for about 12 hours, suggesting that Hungarian lawmakers do not yet have the sense of television that their American counterparts do. The livelier part of the event, the procession that is to carry the 11th-century Crown of St. Stephen to its new home in Parliament, will still take place this afternoon -- and there will be a makeup party in Heroes Square for those who missed the millennial one.</p>
        <p>Compared to the high-priced blowouts in richer countries, Eastern Europe planned relatively modest celebrations. And even these were not spared controversy.</p>
        <p>Warsaw held a disco party in Jozef Pilsudski Square, which Catholic leaders and veterans groups condemned as tasteless because the square contains the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and Pope John Paul II said Mass there twice. The stage for Boney M and other performers was on the same spot as the papal altar.</p>
        <p>In Budapest, even the half-laid plans went awry. Just before fireworks surrounded the beautiful riverside Parliament, the sub-zero weather raised a cold fog from the Danube, rendering them invisible.</p>
        <p>What would, in many other countries, be all the ingredients for a riot were in place: Tens of thousands of chilled teenagers carrying yardlong cardboard horns, with which, by local habit, one belts total strangers over the head without provocation. Crates of $2 champagne on sale everywhere, the price jacked up to $4. Big cherry bombs underfoot. No public toilets. And nary a cop in sight.</p>
        <p>In New York, given the same provocations, the streets would run with blood, suggested a journalist who had been belted for the second time in a minute. ''But we have no guns here,'' explained Zsuzsanna Langi.</p>
        <p>''Yes, in Poland we do this,'' replied Sylvester, the next stranger to belt the same journalist, taking the opportunity of a brief interview to bop him twice more before his horn was bent double. ''In Poland, I do very bad things. But we don't kill. Because in Poland to do such bad things is O.K.''</p>
        <p>In the end, though, it was a peaceful crowd of extraordinarily happy drunks. In Vorosmarty Square, at the stroke of midnight, the locals stiffened and sang the sad, solemn national anthem, ''God Bless the Hungarians.'' And were walloped for it by visiting Poles and Slovenes.</p>
