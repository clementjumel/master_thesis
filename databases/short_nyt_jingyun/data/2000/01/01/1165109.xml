        <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's resignation today drove Russian stocks to their highest levels since the 1998 economic collapse, reflecting hope among investors that the acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, would revive stalled economic reforms.</p>
        <p>The Russian Trading System stock index, the main stock market barometer in the country, rose 18 percent to 177.71. The increase was the greatest one-day jump since July 14, 1998, when the International Monetary Fund agreed to lend Russia $22.8 billion.</p>
        <p>But a month later, the Russian economy collapsed. Since then, the market had languished, with periodic rallies occurring on very low volumes.</p>
        <p>Russian stocks traded in the United States rallied today as well.  Shares of the cellular provider Vimpel Communications, the first Russian company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rose 24.2 percent to $41. The Templeton Russia Fund, a mutual fund that invests primarily in Russian companies, rose 35 percent to $19.9375.</p>
        <p>Golden Telecom, a Russian telecommunications and Internet company traded on the Nasdaq market, rose 164 percent to $32.</p>
        <p>Shares rose on optimism that President Yeltsin's surprise resignation would pave the way for financial reforms.</p>
        <p>The International Monetary Fund said the resignation would not change its relationship with Russia. ''We are not into the political side of things,'' said Stanley Fischer, the deputy managing director of the Washington-based agency.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Yeltsin initiated the changes that have given Russia the beginnings of a market economy, little progress has been made in the last few years. Mr. Yeltsin has either been too ill or too preoccupied with political intrigues to forcefully push reforms through Parliament.</p>
        <p>The hope among investors now is that Mr. Putin, who is younger and apparently more decisive, will take up reforms that have been stalled or shelved.</p>
