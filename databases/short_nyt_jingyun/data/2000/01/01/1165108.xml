        <p>Pakistan's government today welcomed the peaceful end of the hijacking ordeal in neighboring Afghanistan and, like a proud older brother, praised that country's Taliban leaders for ''showing great responsibility and maturity'' in managing the crisis.</p>
        <p>''Their approach throughout this period of stress has been imbued with a sense of humanitarian concern and care and opposition to terrorism which has earned them the appreciation of the entire international community,'' read a testimonial from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
        <p>Pakistan, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are the only countries that recognize the legitimacy of the Taliban government, which, as the host to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born exile accused by the United States of sponsoring terrorism, is not usually blessed as a peacemaker.</p>
        <p>Javed Jabbar, an aide to Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, also credited the Taliban with ''maturity'' in serving as the stern but judicious broker in securing a deal between the Indian government and five desperate hijackers.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the last week may amend somewhat the Western image of the Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan and have been fighting to take the rest, as unyielding religious fanatics preoccupied with the head-to-toe swathing of Afghanistan's women and the maintenance of untrimmed facial hair on its men.</p>
        <p>Will the world now be ready to declare the Taliban rehabilitated? Probably not. But the Taliban may not be seen quite so one-dimensionally as before.</p>
        <p>''The West in particular tends to draw pictures entirely in black and white, and then we act surprised if people don't turn out to be as bad as we thought,'' said Paula Newberg, who has written about Afghanistan for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Newberg does not believe that recent events will end the Taliban's pariah status with other countries, though ''this may go a small way toward changing the adjectives in which the Taliban are described and considered.''</p>
        <p>Of course, much is still unknown about the role the Taliban played in the hostage ordeal. And the ultimate fate of the five hijackers -- and the three militants freed from Indian prisons in the bartering -- has yet to be written.</p>
        <p>At a news conference after the hostages were freed, the Taliban foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed  Muttawakil, said the hijackers and released militants were being given 10 hours to leave the country by road. He said a Taliban official had accompanied the men to insure their safe passage. He gave no indication where they might be heading.</p>
