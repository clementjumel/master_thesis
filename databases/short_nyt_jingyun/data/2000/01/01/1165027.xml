        <p>James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' came up first on a recent list of the 20th century's greatest 100 novels, but in all likelihood few of the 10 writers and critics who drew up that list had read the book they were honoring.

        <p>'ULYSSES,' REVERED BUT UNREADABLE</p>
        <p>James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' came up first on a recent list of the 20th century's greatest 100 novels, but in all likelihood few of the 10 writers and critics who drew up that list had read the book they were honoring. The fact is that ''Ulysses'' has been both revered and unread for decades, and, over the long run, its unreadability will outweigh the reverence it inspires.</p>
        <p>This is a melancholy prediction. Joyce's work is astonishing, full of amazing wordplay and biting lyricism.  Leopold Bloom is a great character, and Dublin emerges from Joyce's pages as a place of mythic magic. But ''Ulysses'' was the product of a modernist moment, and it probably will be seen more and more as a brilliant but impenetrable literary gimmick, one whose essential inaccessibility will reduce its already shrinking audience.</p>
