        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a new millennium dawns, the literary minded may wonder which, if any, writer from the American Century will still be read 1,000 years from now.</p>
        <p>Let me gently reject some worthy also-rans. While Hemingway's style and subject matter influenced us, they may seem tiresomely simplistic in the future. Steinbeck was a tremendous chronicler, but really only of the Depression -- not exactly the characteristic decade of our century. Faulkner was perhaps our most original writer, and maybe people in the fourth millennium will  talk in stream of consciousness (although I'd still defy them to understand all of it written down).</p>
        <p>Wonderful writers all. Many more deserve mention. But none of these are the most likely to be read in the year 3000.</p>
        <p>The most likely answer is F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>
        <p>Fitzgerald understood that the definitive characteristic of 20th-century Americans was our obsessive devotion to personal dreams -- dreams we imbued with a fevered and secret emotional significance. Fitzgerald wrote about this most American of conceits more compellingly than anyone else, and even 1,000 years from now that will be clear.</p>
