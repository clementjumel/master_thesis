        <p>Robert D. Kaplan, like some castle builder near the end of the Middle Ages, has built his structure of the future on the premise that the city itself will survive to be the center of new alliances (Op-Ed, Dec. 27). It is more likely that the city, like the fortified castle that soon succumbed to the new technology of the cannon, will be made obsolete by the new terror technology of the 21st century. Few people will want to congregate in mass clusters if the horrible potential of the new technologies is ever successfully used.</p>

        <p>It is more likely that people will disperse into areas without individual targets of opportunity. Unfortunately, they will probably also be willing to forgo the open society we now enjoy for the sake of the security of a police state. It is far more likely that the beauty of an open, free society in a splendid, dramatic city that we now experience will be a vague memory of a glorious time that once existed.  STEPHEN F. GORDON  Bedford, N.Y., Dec. 27, 1999</p>
