        <p>Yesterday afternoon, Margaret Mullen, a 29-year-old hairdresser at the Jean-Claude Biguine hair salon on 45th Street and Avenue of the Americas, stared out at the thousands of people crowded around the plate-glass windows of the salon and the conga line of young women waiting for Ms. Mullen's tonsorial skills at the front desk.</p>

        <p>Yesterday afternoon, Margaret Mullen, a 29-year-old hairdresser at the Jean-Claude Biguine hair salon on 45th Street and Avenue of the Americas, stared out at the thousands of people crowded around the plate-glass windows of the salon and the conga line of young women waiting for Ms. Mullen's tonsorial skills at the front desk.</p>
        <p>''All these people need our help,'' Ms. Mullen said wearily.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mullen was just one of thousands of people plying the beauty trade yesterday in New York City, just a dutiful handmaiden doing the coifing, manicuring, waxing and whatnot for the rest of womanhood.</p>
        <p>''Last week, it was empty,'' Ms. Mullen said. ''Everyone was away. This week, I get to make everyone else in the world beautiful for their parties.''</p>
        <p>Jennifer Kazawic, an advertising executive with the Odyssey Channel, said she had wrangled tickets to a party at MTV headquarters. Rada Tyutyunikova, a colorist at the salon, said she wanted to go home.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mullen, who lives with her boyfriend, a professional dogwalker, and her 4-year-old daughter in Yorkville, said that her plans were simple: she was going home to have dinner.</p>
        <p>''It won't be very exciting,'' Ms. Mullen said. ''But at 12 'o' clock, Kayla will throw stuff out of the window and scream, and that will make her happy. And sometimes, if you look out my mother's window at the right angle, you can see the fireworks, or something that looks like fireworks, a little bit.''</p>
