        <p>TWO women playing tennis under a star-filled sky, trading volleys for a chance to win a trip to the moon. Three malformed animals trying to destroy a tree that has taken away people's lives and is threatening their master.

        <p>These were among the images that fifth graders at Amistad Academy in New Haven came up with when asked to draw a scene from a day in their lives 20 years hence.

        <p>These were among the images that fifth graders at Amistad Academy in New Haven came up with when asked to draw a scene from a day in their lives 20 years hence. Sure, there were cars that could fly and computers that had swallowed whole rooms. But many of the pictures skipped the cartoonish characters of comic books and animated television, suggesting instead simpler, subtler changes to buildings and buses, grass and sky.</p>
        <p>Tiquentes Gray drew his own auto-body shop, painted bright yellow, where it would cost $90 to get your car fixed. Amanda Bell-King staged a millennium fashion show. (Fubu survives.) The caption that Johnny Walker wrote to explain his picture of a bare-chested man surrounded by a half-blue, half-green background was spare: ''It's a man who is flying to his destiny. It's my uncle.''</p>
        <p>Amistad, a charter school in its first year, serves mostly poor black and Latino students, three-quarters of whom read below grade level. Its hallways are festooned with banners proclaiming the school's values: Respect, Enthusiasm, Achievement, Citizenship, Hard Work (Reach). Here are examples of what the students were thinking as they drew the year 2019.</p>
