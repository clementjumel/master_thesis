        <p>Ray Hubbard, a television producer and broadcasting executive and a pioneer in the medium, died on Monday in Kenwood, Calif. He was 75 and had been suffering from Parkinson's disease.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubbard was vice president for programming and production at Post-Newsweek Stations in Washington, the broadcast group of The Washington Post, from 1969 to 1976. Before that he was the national programming manager and executive producer of public affairs for Group W, the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company in New York, where he helped to develop the Steve Allen, Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin and Regis Philbin shows and ''P.M. East'' with Mike Wallace.</p>
        <p>At Westinghouse, Mr. Hubbard was responsible for programs including ''Discovery,'' a 13-part series on contemporary art produced with the San Francisco Museum of Art; ''Black Culture,'' 65 half-hour programs created with Morgan State University in Baltimore; and ''Children's Spectaculars,'' a series of hourlong dramatic shows featuring Zero Mostel, Boris Karloff, Claire Bloom and others. He also produced a variety of specials, including the Benny Goodman show at the American pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels.</p>
        <p>An advocate of educational children's fare, Mr. Hubbard worked with local school systems and hired writers to create study guides, one of the earliest examples of the interactive use of television in learning. He was responsible for ''Harambee,'' the first daily scheduled black culture-oriented program on American television, and ''Everywoman,'' the first prime-time women's program.</p>
        <p>Upon retiring from Post-Newsweek, Mr. Hubbard produced ''Special Delivery,'' five half-hour programs for children about living with disabilities. He then established Unicorn Projects Inc., a nonprofit production company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubbard was the recipient of  major broadcasting awards including the Emmy, Dupont and George Foster PeabodyAwards.</p>
        <p>Born in Los Angeles, he graduated from the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland in 1942 and earned a master's degree in theater and communications from Stanford University in 1951.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Marion; three sons, Bruce and Stephen, of Pasadena, Calif., and Gregory of Wells, Me.; and two grandchildren.</p>
