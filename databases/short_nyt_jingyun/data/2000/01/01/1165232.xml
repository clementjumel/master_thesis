        <p>GIBSON-Leslie Fuller Larned. Died December 14 at home in Washington, CT. A devoted wife, mother and grandmother, Mrs. Gibson divided her time between her home in CT, a residence in NYC, her son's in Birdsboro, PA, and at Bear Island in Penobscot Bay, ME, a property jointly held with other members of the Fuller family. She was the elder daughter of Edward P. (Ned) Larned and of Lesley Fuller Larned (Mrs. J. Nelson Borland II in later life). She was a devoted niece of Rosamond L. Fuller (Mrs. Alphonse Kenison) of Newcastle, ME; the same of, and to, R. Buckminster Fuller of world-wide address. Among her activities, she was a contributor to Scenic Hudson, and served on its Board of Directors. Her father was a brother of William P. Larned, at one time topranked singles tennis player. Together they were champions in doubles. On December 18, at the First Congregational Church on Washington Green, Rev. Cheryl Anderson led a memorial service for Mrs. Gibson. Immediate survivors are her husband, R. Dana Gibson, a painter (they married in Wiscasset, ME in 1942); also a sister, Mrs. Albert F. Winslow (Katherine P. Larned) of Tuxedo Park, NY; also a son, George Brayton Larned Gibson of Birdsboro, PA; his wife, Lynn Updegrave Gibson, and three grandchildren, Miles, Graham and Lila. Contributions may be sent to ''Save the Shepaug,'' care of the Steep Rock Association, PO Box 279 Washington Depot, CT. 06794 or to Scenic Hudson. Interment will take place in the cemetery by Washington Green when available in April.</p>
