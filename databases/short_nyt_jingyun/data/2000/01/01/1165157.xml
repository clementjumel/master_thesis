        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>If we look at our individual lives and our society, we can understand that we have advanced and benefited significantly from scientific developments in the 20th century. Equally vital components of human life must become priorities in the 21st century: spiritual development (not necessarily religion, although that is one path), artistic knowledge and skills (these are unique ways of experiencing and coming to know the world), and self-esteem (much talked about, but lacking for many people).</p>
        <p>Without opportunities to develop these core human needs, 100 years from now our children and grandchildren could perhaps find themselves in a two-dimensional world. We could lose the ability to interact with anything other than technology.  JEANNE C. POND  Philadelphia, Dec. 30, 1999</p>
