        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Uncertain Blessings of  Longevity'' (editorial, Dec. 30): You refer to the competition among generations that will be provoked by increased longevity. At the International Longevity Center, we are studying the many benefits that will  result from longer life expectancy.</p>
        <p>Healthy longevity has been shown to enhance productivity and wealth. The special needs of an older population have opened new markets and provided new opportunities for economic growth. One of four older people currently plays a significant role in providing financial and nonmonetary support to his or her family. In all likelihood, the 69 million baby boomers who reach 65 by 2020 will  continue to lead productive and creative lives well into their 80's.</p>
