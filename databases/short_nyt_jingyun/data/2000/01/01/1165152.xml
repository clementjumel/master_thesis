        <p>''If I could erase this year and do it over, I would,'' said Anthony Boyce, a heroin addict who wanted to check into a detoxification program and celebrate the dawn of the new year by sleeping through it. ''I need to clear my head and not think about what to do next,'' said Mr. Boyce, 47. ''When you're carrying a load on your shoulders 24 hours a day, it gets to where you can't think of a way out.''</p>
        <p>At the Positive Health Project, a walk-up sanctuary at 305 West 37th St., some of the homeless and destitute shared their modest hopes and considerable fears as a few blocks away Times Square was being readied for New Year's Eve. The project dispenses more than 13,000 clean syringes and 36,000 condoms a month, along with advice about staying healthy on the street.</p>

        <p>''If I could erase this year and do it over, I would,'' said Anthony Boyce, a heroin addict who wanted to check into a detoxification program and celebrate the dawn of the new year by sleeping through it.

The project dispenses more than 13,000 clean syringes and 36,000 condoms a month, along with advice about staying healthy on the street.</p>
        <p>Dolores Serina, 35, said that she had to move into a women's shelter after her husband went to prison for selling drugs and city officials declared their basement room an illegal dwelling. ''Going into the New Year, I'm scared,'' Ms. Serina said.</p>
        <p>''A lot of these people haven't slept last night,'' she said. ''They depend on this place for safety.''</p>
        <p>For the first time, the project's executive director closed the needle exchange and other services this New Year's Eve for fear that his drug users would get swept up by the officers patrolling the celebration at Times Square.</p>
        <p>Mr. Serina said, ''I look around and I see people spending money on all these little gizmo-gadgets and I say, 'My God, if they only gave me a dollar, I'd be all right.' ''</p>
