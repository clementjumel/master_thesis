        <p>A carjacking suspect was shot three times early yesterday in an exchange of gunfire with a team of plainclothes police officers who stopped the car theft on a Bronx street, the police said.</p>
        <p>Three officers were patrolling in an unmarked car near Bronx Community College in University Heights about 1:30 a.m. when a teenage girl flagged them down and said a carjacking was taking place. Three armed men had approached a silver Honda parked at 179th Street and Loring Place South and ordered the occupants, two young men and the girl, to get out of the car, said Sgt. Gerry Falcon, a police spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>As the officers arrived, they saw one of the suspects, identified as Keith Lucas, 17, shooting at the driver, who was running away, Sergeant Falcon said. Mr. Lucas then fired at the officers, she said.</p>
        <p>The officers fired at least 10 shots at Mr. Lucas. Two bullets struck him in the torso and one in the back, a detective investigating the case said. A loaded .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun was found on the ground near where Mr. Lucas fell, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lucas underwent surgery at Lincoln Hospital and was listed in stable condition yesterday. He was under police guard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lucas, of 1950 Andrews Avenue in University Heights, was charged with robbery, attempted murder, criminal possession of a weapon, resisting arrest and reckless endangerment. Sergeant Falcon said he had no criminal record. Detectives were searching yesterday for the two other carjacking suspects.</p>
        <p>The police identified the officers, assigned to an Anti-Crime Unit in the 46th Precinct, as Robert Geary, 27, Sean Sharkey, 27, and Thomas Weather, 28. None of the officers or occupants of the car was injured, the police said.</p>
