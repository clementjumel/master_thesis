        <p>Fighting still rages in Grozny, but the soldiers there made a few bows to the holiday, and seemed oblivious to the political earthquake of President Boris N. Yeltsin's resignation.</p>
        <p>In a hospital's mess tent, cooks prepared a special holiday dinner. One soldier, a woman, dragged a yolka, a Russian holiday tree, past a row of corpses and toward a complex of tents.</p>
        <p>Officers of a nearby armored unit received a small plastic bag filled with cheap cologne, a plastic pen and ''Dear Soldier'' letters from Russian schoolchildren, like one from Andrei Malakhov, a seven-year-old boy from Yefremov, a small town south of Moscow, who said he hoped all the Russian soldiers would come home alive.</p>
        <p>By mid-afternoon, they had already broken open several bottles of vodka and were feasting on bread and pickled cabbage. They had set up camp in a series of trenches that separatist rebels had occupied just weeks ago.</p>
        <p>One officer, who gave only his first name, Aleksandr, said the ''terrorists'' in Chechnya would be finished off within six months.</p>
