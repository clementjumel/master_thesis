        <p>Forces of Nature, a company trained in various forms of African and modern dance, offered a ''Kwanzaa Regeneration Night Celebration 99'' on Tuesday night at Aaron Davis Hall.</p>
        <p>The African-American festival's emphasis upon idealism became clear in a ''Ritual of Nation Building,'' during which children and adults recited statements affirming the importance of personal responsibility and communal action.</p>
        <p>The dance troupe presented four works choreographed by Abdel R. Salaam, who also designed some of the elaborate scenery and costumes. There were two premieres.</p>
        <p>''Forest Guardians'' was a long and demanding solo, danced with admirable control by Dina Wright, in which solemn, lyrical and forceful movements symbolized cycles of creation, destruction and renewal.</p>
        <p>''Rhythm Legacy,'' a group piece, choreographically leaped from era to era and continent to continent. Sheryl Pollard Thomas presided over the action as an Ancestral Figure who served as a guide to the explorations of dance history. At one moment, the performers were bending low to the earth in ways associated with many traditional African dances.</p>
        <p>Moments later, they were tossing one another about in the Lindy and other pop dances associated with swing music. There were also outbursts of acrobatic break dancing.</p>
        <p>All the episodes were wonderfully energetic. But some false climaxes along the way prevented the work from achieving the truly rousing finale it deserved.</p>
        <p>''Rhythm Tree'' and ''Terrestrial Wombs,'' two productions from the company's repertory, also celebrated the rhythms of dance and life. The evening's taped accompaniments ranged from East African chanting to compositions by Steve Reich and Brian Eno. And there was live music by the Spirit Ensemble and a piano interlude by Onaji Allen Gumbs. He played well. Unfortunately, his grand piano sounded unnecessarily overamplified.</p>
