## Dataset & task

Unfortunately, our work relies on the New York Times Annotated Corpus, and we don't own its copyrights. 
For this reason, TESA's dataset and task, will be made available on the Linguistic Data Consortium's website
(https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/).

TESA's dataset and task will be made available soon.
